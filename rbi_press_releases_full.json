    "file_extracted_text": " \nNovember 04, 2025 \n \nFinancial Action Task Force (FATF) High risk and other monitored jurisdictions \u2013 \nOctober 22-24, 2025 \n \n     The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) vide public document \u2018High-Risk Jurisdictions \nsubject to a Call for Action\u2019 \u2013 24 October 2025, has called on its members and other \njurisdictions to refer to the statement on Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK) \nand Iran adopted in February 2020 which remains in effect. Further, Myanmar was added \nto the list of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action in the October 2022 FATF \nplenary and FATF has called on its members and other jurisdictions to apply enhanced \ndue diligence measures proportionate to the risk arising from Myanmar. When applying \nenhanced due diligence measures, countries have been advised to ensure that flows of \nfunds for humanitarian assistance, legitimate NPO activity and remittances are not \ndisrupted. The status of Myanmar in the list of countries subject to a call for action, \nremains unchanged. \n  \n     FATF had earlier identified the following jurisdictions as having strategic deficiencies \nin their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation \nfinancing and had placed the jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring, which had \ndeveloped action plan with the FATF to deal with them. These jurisdictions were:  \nAlgeria, Angola, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, Haiti, Kenya, Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), \nLebanon, Monaco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, South Sudan, \nSyria, Venezuela, Vietnam, Virgin Islands (UK) and Yemen. As per the October 24, 2025 \nFATF public statement Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa have been \nremoved from this list based on review by the FATF. \n \n     FATF plenary releases documents titled \u201cHigh-Risk jurisdictions subject to a Call for \nAction\u201d and \u201cJurisdictions under Increased Monitoring\u201d with respect to jurisdictions that \nhave strategic AML/CFT deficiencies as part of the ongoing efforts to identify and work \nwith jurisdictions with strategic Anti-Money Laundering (AML)/Combating of Financing of \nTerrorism (CFT) deficiencies. This advice does not preclude the regulated entities from \nlegitimate trade and business transactions with these countries and jurisdictions \nmentioned there.  \n     The detailed information is available in the updated public statements and document \nreleased by FATF on October 24, 2025.

The objectives of the \nFATF are to set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory \nand operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and \nother related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. The FATF \nmonitors the progress of its members in implementing necessary measures, reviews \nmoney laundering and terrorist financing techniques and counter-measures, and \npromotes the adoption and implementation of appropriate measures globally. The \nFATF's decision making body, the FATF Plenary, meets three times a year and \nupdates these statements, which may be noted. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                Ajit Prasad \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1443                                                Deputy General Manager  \n                                                                                                     (Communications)                     \n \n \n",
