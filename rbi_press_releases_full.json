    "file_extracted_text": " \n July 23, 2025 \n \nRBI Bulletin \u2013 July 2025 \n \n     Today, the Reserve Bank released the July 2025 issue of its monthly Bulletin. The \nBulletin includes four speeches, four articles and current statistics.  \n \n     The four articles are: I. State of the Economy; II. Revisiting the Oil Price and \nInflation Nexus in India; III. Determinants of Overnight Uncollateralised Money Market \nVolume - An Empirical Assessment; and IV. Household Inflation Expectations in \nIndia: Emerging Trends, Determinants and Impact of Monetary Policy. \n \nI. \nState of the Economy \n     The global macroeconomic environment remained fluid in June and July so far \namidst geo-political tensions and tariff policy uncertainties. Domestic economic \nactivity held up, with improving kharif agricultural season prospects, continuation of \nstrong momentum in the services sector and modest growth in industrial activity. \nHeadline CPI inflation remained below 4 per cent for the fifth consecutive month in \nJune driven by deflation in food prices. System liquidity remained in surplus to \nfacilitate a faster transmission of policy rate cuts to the credit markets. The external \nsector remained resilient, backed by ample foreign exchange reserves and a \nmoderate external debt-to-GDP ratio. \n \nII. \nRevisiting the Oil Price and Inflation Nexus in India \nBy Sujata Kundu, Soumasree Tewari and Indranil Bhattacharyya \n     In the backdrop of volatile global crude oil prices and a less regulated petrol and \ndiesel prices regime, this paper reassesses the impact of international crude oil price \nmovements on headline inflation in the Indian context.  \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 \nSince the pandemic, the global economy has experienced large gyrations in \ncrude oil prices. India, being a net oil importer, has remained susceptible to the \nvagaries of global crude oil prices and has been actively intervening in the \ndomestic fuel market to contain the adverse fallout of higher oil prices on \ndomestic inflation and output. \n \n\u2022 \nEmpirical estimates suggest that a 10 per cent rise in global crude oil prices \ncould increase India\u2019s headline inflation by around 20 basis points on a \ncontemporaneous basis. In the post-pandemic period, the impact on inflation, \nalthough largely contained, has been statistically significant with the surge in \ncrude oil prices owing to the post-pandemic demand revival, which further \nintensified due to the supply chain disruptions caused by the outbreak of the \nRussia-Ukraine war in early 2022.  \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n\u2022 \nWhile Government measures have limited the impact of global crude oil price \nfluctuations on headline inflation, increase in oil import dependency warrants \nmeasures not only to contain the spillovers to domestic prices but also to \ngradually transit towards alternative sources of fuel for more efficient \nmanagement of domestic fuel prices in the long run. \n \nIII. \nDeterminants of Overnight Uncollateralised Money Market Volume \n- An Empirical Assessment \n \nBy Srijashree Sardar and Alqama Pervez \n \n     The uncollateralised money market holds a pivotal position in India\u2019s monetary \nframework, serving as the principal avenue for the exchange of central bank \nreserves. Its significance is further underscored by the fact that the weighted average \ncall rate (WACR) functions as the operating target of the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s \nmonetary policy. Against this backdrop, the article seeks to empirically examine the \nfactors influencing trading volumes in the unsecured interbank segment of the Indian \nmoney market. \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 The temporal distribution of trades in the call money market exhibits skewness \nwithin the day. The bulk of the trades occur in the first hour of any given day \nwhich may be attributed to the fact that primary dealers, the major borrowers in \nthe segment, tend to fulfil their funding needs early in the day. \n \n\u2022 System liquidity conditions, spread of the weighted average call rate over the \npolicy repo rate, divergence of overnight forward premia from interest rate \ndifferential, inflows to and outflows from government accounts, trading volume of \nthe collateralised segment and market trading hours are found to have a \nsignificant impact on call volume during the period of the study (2019-2024). \n \n\u2022 Divergence of overnight forward premia from the interest rate differential has a \npositive impact on call volume, indicating arbitrage by banks during times of such \ndivergence. \n \n\u2022 Co-operative banks participation in call money market decreased significantly \nafter the Reserve Bank\u2019s directive for mandatory membership on NDS-CALL \ntrading platform for call money market activity. It has, however, rebounded in the \nrecent months, following an increase in membership of co-operative banks. \n \nIV. \nHousehold \nInflation \nExpectations \nin \nIndia: \nEmerging \nTrends, \nDeterminants and Impact of Monetary Policy \n \n By Ankit Ruhi, Kanupriya Sharma and Subhadhra Sankaran \n     Household inflation expectations rose in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic \nand geopolitical tensions, and have remained largely elevated since. In view of these \ndevelopments, this article analyses the evolving trends in household inflation \nexpectations. It proposes alternative methods for adjusting higher values of \nexpectations reported in Inflation Expectations Survey of Households and identifies \nthe key macroeconomic factors influencing these expectations. Finally, the impact of \npolicy interventions, especially since the adoption of flexible inflation targeting (FIT) \nregime, is also examined. \n3 \n \n \nHighlights: \n\u2022 \nHouseholds\u2019 inflation expectations exhibit systematic upward bias compared to \nthose of professionals and businesses, even in periods of stable or low inflation. \n \n\u2022 \nMedian inflation expectation and the disagreement across demographic groups is \ngradually moderating since 2023-24. \n \n\u2022 \nPerceived past inflation expectations add to stickiness in household expectations \neven as influence of realised inflation dynamics becomes stronger when \nexpectations are adjusted for extreme values.  \n \n\u2022 \nTransition to the FIT regime has successfully aided in stabilising inflation \nexpectations. Monetary policy actions are found to effectively anchor inflation \nexpectations. \n \n\u2022 \nWhile headline inflation is more influential than food inflation, volatile and broad-\nbased food inflation may keep overall expectations elevated, underscoring the \nimportance of continued policy emphasis on headline inflation. \n \n     The views expressed in the Bulletin articles are of the authors and do not \nrepresent the views of the Reserve Bank of India. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/769                                               Chief General Manager \n",
