    "file_extracted_text": " \n July 23, 2025 \n \nRBI Bulletin \u2013 July 2025 \n \n     Today, the Reserve Bank released the July 2025 issue of its monthly Bulletin. The \nBulletin includes four speeches, four articles and current statistics.  \n \n     The four articles are: I. State of the Economy; II. Revisiting the Oil Price and \nInflation Nexus in India; III. Determinants of Overnight Uncollateralised Money Market \nVolume - An Empirical Assessment; and IV. Household Inflation Expectations in \nIndia: Emerging Trends, Determinants and Impact of Monetary Policy. \n \nI. \nState of the Economy \n     The global macroeconomic environment remained fluid in June and July so far \namidst geo-political tensions and tariff policy uncertainties. Domestic economic \nactivity held up, with improving kharif agricultural season prospects, continuation of \nstrong momentum in the services sector and modest growth in industrial activity. \nHeadline CPI inflation remained below 4 per cent for the fifth consecutive month in \nJune driven by deflation in food prices. System liquidity remained in surplus to \nfacilitate a faster transmission of policy rate cuts to the credit markets. The external \nsector remained resilient, backed by ample foreign exchange reserves and a \nmoderate external debt-to-GDP ratio. \n \nII. \nRevisiting the Oil Price and Inflation Nexus in India \nBy Sujata Kundu, Soumasree Tewari and Indranil Bhattacharyya \n     In the backdrop of volatile global crude oil prices and a less regulated petrol and \ndiesel prices regime, this paper reassesses the impact of international crude oil price \nmovements on headline inflation in the Indian context.  \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 \nSince the pandemic, the global economy has experienced large gyrations in \ncrude oil prices. India, being a net oil importer, has remained susceptible to the \nvagaries of global crude oil prices and has been actively intervening in the \ndomestic fuel market to contain the adverse fallout of higher oil prices on \ndomestic inflation and output. \n \n\u2022 \nEmpirical estimates suggest that a 10 per cent rise in global crude oil prices \ncould increase India\u2019s headline inflation by around 20 basis points on a \ncontemporaneous basis. In the post-pandemic period, the impact on inflation, \nalthough largely contained, has been statistically significant with the surge in \ncrude oil prices owing to the post-pandemic demand revival, which further \nintensified due to the supply chain disruptions caused by the outbreak of the \nRussia-Ukraine war in early 2022.  \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n\u2022 \nWhile Government measures have limited the impact of global crude oil price \nfluctuations on headline inflation, increase in oil import dependency warrants \nmeasures not only to contain the spillovers to domestic prices but also to \ngradually transit towards alternative sources of fuel for more efficient \nmanagement of domestic fuel prices in the long run. \n \nIII. \nDeterminants of Overnight Uncollateralised Money Market Volume \n- An Empirical Assessment \n \nBy Srijashree Sardar and Alqama Pervez \n \n     The uncollateralised money market holds a pivotal position in India\u2019s monetary \nframework, serving as the principal avenue for the exchange of central bank \nreserves. Its significance is further underscored by the fact that the weighted average \ncall rate (WACR) functions as the operating target of the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s \nmonetary policy. Against this backdrop, the article seeks to empirically examine the \nfactors influencing trading volumes in the unsecured interbank segment of the Indian \nmoney market. \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 The temporal distribution of trades in the call money market exhibits skewness \nwithin the day. The bulk of the trades occur in the first hour of any given day \nwhich may be attributed to the fact that primary dealers, the major borrowers in \nthe segment, tend to fulfil their funding needs early in the day. \n \n\u2022 System liquidity conditions, spread of the weighted average call rate over the \npolicy repo rate, divergence of overnight forward premia from interest rate \ndifferential, inflows to and outflows from government accounts, trading volume of \nthe collateralised segment and market trading hours are found to have a \nsignificant impact on call volume during the period of the study (2019-2024). \n \n\u2022 Divergence of overnight forward premia from the interest rate differential has a \npositive impact on call volume, indicating arbitrage by banks during times of such \ndivergence. \n \n\u2022 Co-operative banks participation in call money market decreased significantly \nafter the Reserve Bank\u2019s directive for mandatory membership on NDS-CALL \ntrading platform for call money market activity. It has, however, rebounded in the \nrecent months, following an increase in membership of co-operative banks. \n \nIV. \nHousehold \nInflation \nExpectations \nin \nIndia: \nEmerging \nTrends, \nDeterminants and Impact of Monetary Policy \n \n By Ankit Ruhi, Kanupriya Sharma and Subhadhra Sankaran \n     Household inflation expectations rose in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic \nand geopolitical tensions, and have remained largely elevated since. In view of these \ndevelopments, this article analyses the evolving trends in household inflation \nexpectations. It proposes alternative methods for adjusting higher values of \nexpectations reported in Inflation Expectations Survey of Households and identifies \nthe key macroeconomic factors influencing these expectations. Finally, the impact of \npolicy interventions, especially since the adoption of flexible inflation targeting (FIT) \nregime, is also examined. \n3 \n \n \nHighlights: \n\u2022 \nHouseholds\u2019 inflation expectations exhibit systematic upward bias compared to \nthose of professionals and businesses, even in periods of stable or low inflation. \n \n\u2022 \nMedian inflation expectation and the disagreement across demographic groups is \ngradually moderating since 2023-24. \n \n\u2022 \nPerceived past inflation expectations add to stickiness in household expectations \neven as influence of realised inflation dynamics becomes stronger when \nexpectations are adjusted for extreme values.  \n \n\u2022 \nTransition to the FIT regime has successfully aided in stabilising inflation \nexpectations. Monetary policy actions are found to effectively anchor inflation \nexpectations. \n \n\u2022 \nWhile headline inflation is more influential than food inflation, volatile and broad-\nbased food inflation may keep overall expectations elevated, underscoring the \nimportance of continued policy emphasis on headline inflation. \n \n     The views expressed in the Bulletin articles are of the authors and do not \nrepresent the views of the Reserve Bank of India. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/769                                               Chief General Manager \n",

The value of FI-\nIndex for March 2025 stands at 67.0 vis-\u00e0-vis 64.2 in March 2024, with growth \nwitnessed across all sub-indices, viz., Access, Usage and Quality.  Improvement in \nFI-Index in FY 2025 is contributed by Usage and Quality dimensions, reflecting \ndeepening of financial inclusion, and sustained financial literacy initiatives.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/759                                              Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/751                                              Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

The market participants can bid in the switch auction through the Switch Transaction \nmodule provided in the e-Kuber portal. \nBidding in a switch transaction \n \n2. Bidding in the auction implies that the market participants agree to sell the source \nsecurity/ies to the Government of India (GoI) and simultaneously agree to buy the \ndestination security from the GoI at their respective quoted prices. \n \nPlacing of bids \n \n3. Each bid should specify the following details: \n \nI. \nAmount of the source security (Face Value) that the participants are willing to sell. \nII. \nPrice of the source security (expressed up to two decimal places). \nIII. \nChoice of destination security and the price of the destination security (expressed up to \ntwo decimal places), at which the participants are willing to buy the destination security. \n \n4. The participants can choose to bid for any/all the destination security/ies, but the \naggregate amount of bids for the source security should not exceed their holdings of the \nsource security in face value terms. \n \nMinimum Bid size \n \n5. Minimum bid size would be \u20b910,000 and in multiples of \u20b910,000 thereafter. The \nparticipants are allowed to submit multiple bids. However, the aggregate amount of bids \nsubmitted should not exceed the notified amount of source security/basket of source \nsecurities in the auction. \n \nPrice of source security \n \n6. The price of the source security quoted must be equal to the FBIL closing price of \nthe source security as on the previous working day. \n \n7. Bids for source security not as per the price mentioned above will be rejected. \n \nPrice of destination security \n \n8. Bids for the destination security may be placed after taking into account the price of \nsource security as mentioned above. \n \nMethod of auction \n \n9. The auction will be a multiple-price based auction, i.e. successful bids will get accepted \nat their respective quoted prices for the source and destination securities. \nAuction decision \n \n10. The auction cut-off will be decided based on the price of the destination \nsecurity/ies. \n \n11. Successful bidders are those who have placed their bids at or above the cut-off price. \nAll bids lower than the cut-off price will be rejected. \n \n4 \n \n12. There will be provision of pro-rata allotment, should there be more than one \nsuccessful bid at the cut-off price. \n \nAmount of destination security and dealing in odd amounts during switch auction \n \n13. The switch ratio, which is the ratio of the price of the source security to the price of \nthe destination security, would be rounded off at 8 decimal places. \n \n14. The amount of destination security to be issued for each successful bid will be \ncomputed by multiplying the allotted amount (FV) of the source security with the rounded-\noff switch ratio. The amount of destination security (FV) would be rounded-off to the \nnearest lower value in multiples of \u20b910,000. \n \n15. The odd amount of destination securities (less than \u20b910,000) which has been \nrounded-off, would be notionally allotted and bought back from the bidders at the quoted \nbid price of the destination security. The net cash consideration to be paid to the bidder \nfor such odd amounts would be the clean price of these securities (as the accrued \ninterest received during notional allotment and paid during notional buyback offset each \nother). \n \nFund settlement \n \n16. Though the conversion would be broadly cash neutral, there will be fund settlement \nfor the net accrued interest (accrued interest for the source security FV \u2013 accrued interest \nfor the destination security FV) for each bid. Cash consideration (due to rounding-off of \nface value of destination security) computed for each bid would be added to the net \naccrued interest.  Accordingly, fund settlement will be done for the final amount (Net \naccrued interest + cash consideration) for each bid. \n \nNote: An illustration for the calculation of cash consideration due to rounding-off of \ndestination security face value is as given below: \n \nAmount of Source Security (FV) \n\u20b910,00,00,000.00 \nPrice of Source Security  \n\u20b997.50 \nPrice of Destination Security  \n\u20b999.20 \nSwitch Ratio (rounded-off at 8 decimals) \n0.98286290 \nDestination Security FV before rounding off  \n\u20b99,82,86,290.00 \nDestination Security FV re-issued after rounding-off  \n\u20b99,82,80,000.00 \nOdd amount of rounded-off destination security (FV) \n\u20b96290.00 \nCash consideration due to rounding off (Clean Price \ncalculated at the quoted price of destination security) \n\u20b96240.00 \n \n17. The settlement of the auction would be held on T+1 basis. \n \nHelp Desk \n \n18. In case of technical difficulties, Core Banking Operations Team should be contacted \n(email; Phone no: 022-69870466, 022-69870415).
