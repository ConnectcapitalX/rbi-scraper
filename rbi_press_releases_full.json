This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred \non RBI under the provisions of Section 30(1) read with Section 26(6) of the Payment \nand Settlement Systems Act, 2007. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the company was conducted by RBI with reference to \nits operations for the period from October 2023 to December 2024. Based on \nsupervisory \nfindings \nof \nnon-compliance \nwith \nRBI \ndirections \nand \nrelated \ncorrespondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the company advising it to \nshow cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure to comply \nwith the said directions.  \n \n     After considering the company\u2019s reply to the notice, additional submissions made \nby it and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, \nthat the following charge against the company was sustained, warranting imposition \nof monetary penalty:  \n \n     The end of the day balance in the escrow account of the company was less than \nthe value of outstanding PPls and payments due to merchants on certain days and \nthe company did not report shortfall in the said escrow account to RBI immediately. \n  \n     The action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \ncompany with its customers. Further, imposition of monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the company.  \n \n \n \n \n \n              (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1094                                             Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

The market participants can bid in the switch auction through the Switch Transaction \nmodule provided in the e-Kuber portal. \nBidding in a switch transaction \n2. Bidding in the auction implies that the market participants agree to sell the source \nsecurity/ies to the Government of India (GoI) and simultaneously agree to buy the \ndestination security from the GoI at their respective quoted prices. \nPlacing of bids \n3. Each bid should specify the following details: \nI. \nAmount of the source security (Face Value) that the participants are willing to sell. \nII. \nPrice of the source security (expressed up to two decimal places). \nIII. \nChoice of destination security and the price of the destination security (expressed up to \ntwo decimal places), at which the participants are willing to buy the destination security. \n4. The participants can choose to bid for any/all the destination security/ies, but the \naggregate amount of bids for the source security should not exceed their holdings of the \nsource security in face value terms.   \nMinimum Bid size \n5. Minimum bid size would be \u20b910,000 and in multiples of \u20b910,000 thereafter. The \nparticipants are allowed to submit multiple bids. However, the aggregate amount of bids \nsubmitted should not exceed the notified amount of source security/basket of source \nsecurities in the auction.  \nPrice of source security \n6. The price of the source security quoted must be equal to the FBIL closing price of \nthe source security as on the previous working day. \n7. Bids for source security not as per the price mentioned above will be rejected.  \nPrice of destination security \n8. Bids for the destination security may be placed after taking into account the price of \nsource security as mentioned above.  \nMethod of auction \n9. The auction will be a multiple-price based auction, i.e. successful bids will get accepted \nat their respective quoted prices for the source and destination securities. \nAuction decision \n10. The auction cut-off will be decided based on the price of the destination \nsecurity/ies. \n11. Successful bidders are those who have placed their bids at or above the cut-off price. \nAll bids lower than the cut-off price will be rejected. \n12. There will be provision of pro-rata allotment, should there be more than one \nsuccessful bid at the cut-off price.  \n4 \n \n \n \nAmount of destination security and dealing in odd amounts during switch auction \n13. The switch ratio, which is the ratio of the price of the source security to the price of \nthe destination security, would be rounded off at 8 decimal places. \n14. The amount of destination security to be issued for each successful bid will be \ncomputed by multiplying the allotted amount (FV) of the source security with the rounded-\noff switch ratio. The amount of destination security (FV) would be rounded-off to the \nnearest lower value in multiples of \u20b910,000.  \n15. The odd amount of destination securities (less than \u20b910,000) which has been \nrounded-off, would be notionally allotted and bought back from the bidders at the quoted \nbid price of the destination security. The net cash consideration to be paid to the bidder \nfor such odd amounts would be the clean price of these securities (as the accrued \ninterest received during notional allotment and paid during notional buyback offset each \nother). \nFund settlement \n16. Though the conversion would be broadly cash neutral, there will be fund settlement \nfor the net accrued interest (accrued interest for the source security FV \u2013 accrued interest \nfor the destination security FV) for each bid. Cash consideration (due to rounding-off of \nface value of destination security) computed for each bid would be added to the net \naccrued interest.  Accordingly, fund settlement will be done for the final amount (Net \naccrued interest + cash consideration) for each bid. \nNote: An illustration for the calculation of cash consideration due to rounding-off of \ndestination security face value is as given below: \nAmount of Source Security (FV) \n\u20b910,00,00,000.00 \nPrice of Source Security  \n\u20b997.50 \nPrice of Destination Security  \n\u20b999.20 \nSwitch Ratio (rounded-off at 8 decimals) \n0.98286290 \nDestination Security FV before rounding off  \n\u20b99,82,86,290.00 \nDestination Security FV re-issued after rounding-off  \n\u20b99,82,80,000.00 \nOdd amount of rounded-off destination security (FV) \n\u20b96290.00 \nCash consideration due to rounding off (Clean Price \ncalculated at the quoted price of destination security) \n\u20b96240.00 \n17. The settlement of the auction would be held on T+1 basis. \nHelp Desk \n18.

(the bank) for non-compliance with the certain directions \nissued by RBI on \u2018Exposure Norms and Statutory/Other Restrictions - UCBs\u2019. This penalty \nhas been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section \n47A (1)(c) read with Sections 46 (4)(i) and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.   \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by the RBI with reference to its \nfinancial position as on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-compliance \nwith RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the \nbank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure \nto comply with the said directions. After considering the bank\u2019s reply to the notice and oral \nsubmissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter-alia, that the following \ncharges against the bank were sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty - \nThe bank had: \n \n(i) breached the prudential inter-bank (gross) exposure limit; and  \n \n(ii) breached the prudential inter-bank counter-party exposure limit. \n \n     This action is based on deficiency in regulatory compliance and is not intended to \npronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank \nwith its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without prejudice to any \nother action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n                (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1066                                              Chief General Manager \n \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u01d0\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

    "file_extracted_text": " \n September 09, 2025 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on Tripura State Co-operative Bank Limited \n \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated September 02, 2025, \nimposed a monetary penalty of \u20b97.50 lakh (Rupees Seven Lakh Fifty Thousand only) \non Tripura State Co-operative Bank Ltd. (the bank) for non-compliance with certain \ndirections issued by RBI on \u2018Know Your Customer (KYC)\u2019. This penalty has been \nimposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section 47A \n(1)(c) read with Sections 46 (4)(i) and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.   \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by the National Bank for \nAgriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) with reference to its financial position \nas on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-compliance with RBI \ndirections and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the bank \nadvising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure \nto comply with the said directions. After considering the bank\u2019s reply to the notice and \noral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter-alia, that the \nfollowing charge against the bank was sustained, warranting imposition of monetary \npenalty: \n \n     The bank had failed to upload KYC records of customers onto Central KYC \nRecords Registry (CKYCR) within the prescribed timeline.  \n \n     This action is based on deficiency in regulatory compliance and is not intended to \npronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank \nwith its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without prejudice to \nany other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1065                                             Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without prejudice to \nany other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1059                                             Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
