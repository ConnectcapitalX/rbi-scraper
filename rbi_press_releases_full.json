This penalty \nhas been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of \nSection 47A(1)(c) read with Sections 46(4)(i) and 56 of the BR Act. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by National Bank for \nAgriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) with reference to its financial position \nas on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-compliance with \nstatutory provisions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued \nto the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it \nfor its failure to comply with the said provisions. After considering the bank\u2019s reply to \nthe notice and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter \nalia, that the following charge against the bank was sustained, warranting imposition \nof monetary penalty: \n \n     The bank had failed to transfer eligible unclaimed amounts to the Depositor \nEducation and Awareness Fund within the prescribed time. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in statutory compliance and is not intended to \npronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank \nwith its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without prejudice to \nany other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1368                                        Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

While the LEI uniquely identifies the counterparties to an OTC \nderivative transaction, the UTI serves as a single unique reference number for a \ntransaction. It enables policy makers to obtain a comprehensive view of OTC \nderivatives markets by facilitating global aggregation of transactions. The reporting of \nLEI has been mandated for OTC derivative transactions in most major jurisdictions \nglobally. UTI has also been implemented / is in the process of being implemented in \nmany of the major jurisdictions. In India, LEI has already been implemented. It is now \nproposed to mandate UTI for all OTC derivative transactions.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1367                                       Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

    "file_extracted_text": "1 \n \n \nOctober 20, 2025 \n \nRBI Bulletin \u2013 October 2025 \n     Today, the Reserve Bank released the October 2025 issue of its monthly Bulletin. \nThe Bulletin includes bi-monthly monetary policy statement (October 2025), five \nspeeches, five articles and current statistics.  \n     The five articles are: I. State of the Economy; II. Resilience and Revival: India\u2019s \nPrivate Corporate Sector; III. Fundraising by Indian Small and Medium Enterprises \nthrough IPO: Recent Trends and Developments; IV. Compliance to Confidence: A Data \nQuality Model for Central Banks; and V. Steel Under Siege: Understanding the Impact \nof Dumping on India. \nI. \nState of the Economy \n     Global uncertainty has edged up. In the US, both trade and economic policy \nuncertainty increased in September. Global growth, however, has broadly held up. \nInvestor sentiments dampened in October, on renewed US-China trade tensions and \nprolonged US government shutdown, after a phase of buoyancy. The Indian economy \ndisplayed resilience amidst broader global uncertainty and weak external demand. \nHigh-frequency indicators point to a revival in urban demand and robust rural demand. \nHeadline consumer price index (CPI) inflation moderated sharply in September, \nmarking its lowest reading since June 2017. \nII. \nResilience and Revival: India\u2019s Private Corporate Sector \nBy Snigdha Yogindran, Sukti Khandekar, Rajesh Kavediya and Kamal Gupta \n     The study highlights how India\u2019s private corporates navigated the COVID pandemic \nshock and emerged stronger. Based on financial data of listed non-government non-\nfinancial companies, the study underscores the sector\u2019s ability to withstand global \nshocks with adaptability, profitability, and strengthening of balance sheets in the post-\npandemic period.  \nHighlights: \n\u2022 Corporate sales rebounded sharply post-pandemic, peaking at 32.5 per cent \ngrowth in 2021-22 over the contraction recorded during the pandemic period, \nbefore stabilising at 7.2 per cent in 2024-25. \n\u2022 Net profits rose significantly to \u20b97.1 trillion in 2024-25 from \u20b92.5 trillion in 2020-21. \nConsequently, the net profit margin improved to 10.3 per cent during 2024-25 from \n7.2 per cent in 2020-21.  \n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u093f\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central O\ufb03ce, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n\u2022 Corporates continued to deleverage their balance sheet supported by \ncapitalisation of higher profit, with debt-to-equity ratios improving across firm sizes. \n\u2022 Interest coverage ratio for manufacturing firms improved significantly, reaching 7.7, \non an average during post-COVID period, reflecting robust debt-servicing capacity. \n\u2022 Large firms drove profitability, while medium and small firms demonstrated greater \nimprovement in debt servicing capacity than the large firms.  \nIII. \nFundraising by Indian Small and Medium Enterprises through IPO: Recent \nTrends and Developments \nBy Bhagyashree Chattopadhyay and Shromona Ganguly \n     Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are vital to India\u2019s economic growth, but \noften face constraints in accessing formal finance. In recent years, dedicated SME \nexchanges have emerged as an important platform for fundraising through Initial \nPublic Offerings (IPOs). This article examines the performance and trends of SME \nIPOs in India during FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25, analysing their evolution, market \nbehaviour, and investors\u2019 response. \nHighlights: \n\u2022 \nThe SME IPO market in India saw a sharp surge in activity during FY 2023-24 and \nFY 2024-25, supported by strong retail participation, and favourable market \nsentiment. During most of this time, SME IPOs recorded high oversubscription \nlevels and listing gains.  \n\u2022 \nMacroeconomic and policy factors like overall market buoyancy, and advancement \nin payment and settlement mechanism in the IPO market drove this boom.  \n\u2022 \nMost IPO proceeds were used for capital enhancement or working capital purpose \nby the SMEs. Despite robust listing gain, post-listing performances of these SME \nstocks reveal both opportunities and risks for the investors.  \nIV. \nCompliance to Confidence: A Data Quality Model for Central Banks \nBy Debasis Nandi and Sujeesh Kumar \n     The functioning of the central bank involves collection of huge volume of banking \nand financial sector data from the regulated entities. In the complex data ecosystem, \nensuring the quality of data becomes challenging for central banks. As the central bank \nis entrusted with collection of various type of data - regulatory, supervisory and \nstatistical, this article presents an approach for constructing a data quality index (DQI) \nto evaluate the quality of data submitted by regulated entities.  \nHighlights: \n\u2022 \nThe methodology described in this article outlines a stepwise approach for \nconstructing the DQI using eight data quality dimensions. It broadens upon four \ndata quality dimensions typically applied in the Indian banking supervisory \nlandscape, encompassing data collection and dissemination processes. \n\u2022 \nThe DQI framework provided in this article enables central banks and regulators to \nmonitor and improve data quality systematically enhancing institutional credibility, \nregulatory and supervisory efficiency, and public trust. \n3 \n \n\u2022 \nThe framework highlights the significance of automation in data generation and \ncollection processes for enhancement of data quality in the institutional data \ngovernance. \nV. \nSteel Under Siege: Understanding the Impact of Dumping on India \nBy Anirban Sanyal and Sanjay Singh \n     India's steel sector faced significant headwinds due to cheap imports and dumping \nfrom major global steel producers during 2023-24 and 2024-25. Against the backdrop, \nthis paper analyses the impact of cheap imports on India\u2019s domestic production and \nconsumption of steel at aggregate level. Further, the price sensitivity of steel imports \nis evaluated through average import elasticity across import destinations. \nHighlights: \n\u2022 Steel imports have seen a surge largely driven by lower import price of steel and it \nimpacted the domestic production of steel adversely. \n\u2022 The average price elasticity of India's steel imports varies in the range of 0.73-1.01 \nwhich suggests that given the strong domestic demand of steel products, the \nimport intensity was elevated primarily due to price effects. Lower price point from \nimports led to a substitution of domestically produced steel to meet the elevated \nsteel demand. \n\u2022 The dumping of cheap steel from global producers may pose a risk to the domestic \nsteel production which can be mitigated through suitable policy measures. The \nrecent initiative to impose the safeguard duty provides insulation against the import \ndumping. \n     The views expressed in the Bulletin articles are of the authors and do not represent \nthe views of the Reserve Bank of India. \n \n \n                              \n                (Brij Raj)        \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1355                                             Chief General Manager \n \n",

This penalty \nhas been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of \nSection 47A(1)(c) read with Sections 46(4)(i) and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, \n1949. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by RBI with reference to its \nfinancial position as on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice \nwas issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be \nimposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the \nbank\u2019s reply to the notice and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, \nRBI found, inter alia, that the following charges against the bank were sustained, \nwarranting imposition of monetary penalty: \n \nThe bank had failed to:  \ni) carry out periodic review of risk categorisation of accounts, with such periodicity \nbeing at least once in six months; and \nii) upload KYC records of customers onto Central KYC Records Registry \n(CKYCR) within the prescribed timeline.  \n \n    This action is based on deficiency in regulatory compliance and is not intended to \npronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank \nwith its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without prejudice to \nany other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1330                                        Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
