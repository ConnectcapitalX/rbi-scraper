The information collected in the survey includes quantitative data on new orders \nreceived during the reference quarter, backlog of orders at the beginning of the quarter, \npending orders at the end of the quarter, total inventories with a breakup between \n\ufb01nished goods (FG), work-in-progress (WiP) and raw material (RM) inventories at the \nend of the quarter, item-wise production in terms of quantity and value during the \nquarter vis-\u00e0-vis the installed capacity from the targeted group and the reasons for \nchanges in production / installed capacity during the quarter. The level of capacity \nutilisation (CU) is estimated from these responses. The survey provides valuable input \nfor monetary policy formulation. The survey findings are released on the website of the \nBank regularly. \n \n     During this quarter, selected manufacturing companies will be approached by the \nBank. Other manufacturing companies may also participate in the survey by \ndownloading \nthe \nsurvey \nquestionnaire \nfrom \nthe \nReserve \nBank\u2019s \nwebsite \nhttps://www.rbi.org.in.

The bank may incur expenditure in \nrespect of certain essential items such as salaries of employees, rent, electricity bills, \netc., as specified in the said Directions. \n  \n2. RBI has in the recent past engaged with the Board and Senior Management of the \nbank for improvement in its functioning. However, lack of concrete efforts taken by the \nbank to address the supervisory concerns and to protect the interest of depositors of \nthe bank, necessitated issuance of these Directions.  \n \n3. The eligible depositors would be entitled to receive deposit insurance claim amount \nof their deposits upto a monetary ceiling of \u20b95,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakh only) in the \nsame capacity and in the same right, from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee \nCorporation (DICGC), as applicable under the provisions of the DICGC Act, 1961, \nbased on submission of willingness by the depositors concerned and after due \nverification.

After considering the bank's reply to the notice, \noral submissions made during the personal hearing and additional submissions made \nby it, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charges against the bank were \nsustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: \n \nThe bank: \n \ni) (a) did not upload the KYC records of certain customers onto Central KYC Records  \nRegistry (CKYCR) within the prescribed timeline,  \n (b) did not carry out periodic updation of KYC of certain customers as per the \nprescribed periodicity; and \n \nii) allotted multiple customer identification codes to certain individual customers, \ninstead of a Unique Customer Identification Code (UCIC) for each individual \ncustomer. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers.
