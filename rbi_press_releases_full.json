    "file_extracted_text": " \n February 12, 2026 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on The Berhampur Co-operative Urban Bank \nLimited, Odisha \n \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated February 11, 2026, \nimposed a monetary penalty of \u20b92 lakh (Rupees Two Lakh only) on The Berhampur \nCo-operative Urban Bank Limited, Odisha (the bank) for non-compliance with certain \ndirections issued by RBI on \u2018Exposure Norms and Statutory/ Other Restrictions - \nUCBs\u2019. This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under \nthe provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read with Sections 46(4)(i) and 56 of the Banking \nRegulation Act, 1949. \n   \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by RBI with reference to its \nfinancial position as on March 31, 2025. Based on supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice \nwas issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be \nimposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the \nbank\u2019s reply to the notice, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charge against the \nbank was sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: \n \n     The bank had breached the prudential inter-bank (gross) exposure limit and inter-\nbank counter-party limit. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers.

The above draft Amendment Directions propose to rationalise the definition of \nunsecured advances, enhance the individual loan limits for such advances and revise \nthe aggregate ceiling for such advances by UCBs to 20% of total advances from the \nextant ceiling of 10% of total assets. Further, the lending limit to nominal members for \npurchase of consumer durables is also proposed to be enhanced to \u20b92.5 lakh per \nborrower.

    "file_extracted_text": " \nFebruary 09, 2026 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on Bharat Co-operative Bank (Mumbai) Limited \n \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated February 6, 2026, \nimposed a monetary penalty of \u20b915 lakh (Rupees Fifteen Lakh only) on Bharat Co-\noperative Bank (Mumbai) Limited (the bank), for non-compliance with certain \ndirections issued by RBI on \u2018Interest Rate on Deposits\u2019. This penalty has been \nimposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section \n47A(1)(c) read with Sections 46(4)(i) and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.    \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by RBI with reference to its \nfinancial position as on March 31, 2025. Based on supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice \nwas issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be \nimposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the \nbank\u2019s reply to the notice and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, \nRBI found, inter alia, that the following charge against the bank was sustained, \nwarranting imposition of monetary penalty:  \n \n     The bank did not pay any interest on certain eligible term deposits, which were \nwithdrawn prematurely. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/2075                                         Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

    "file_extracted_text": " \nFebruary 06, 2026 \n \nRisk-based Premium Framework for Deposit Insurance in India \n \n     In pursuance of the announcement made in the Statement on Developmental and \nRegulatory Policies dated October 01, 2025, Deposit Insurance and Credit \nGuarantee Corporation (DICGC), with approval of Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has \ntoday advised the insured banks on implementation of Risk Based Premium (RBP) \nframework. The framework aims to incentivise sound risk management by banks and \nreduce premium to be paid by better rated banks. \n \nBackground:  DICGC has been operating the deposit insurance since 1962 on a flat \nrate premium system [presently 12 paise per \u20b9100 of assessable deposits (AD)]. Flat \nrate premium system is simple to understand and administer but does not \ndifferentiate banks which manage the risks better. DICGC Act, 1961 [Section 15(1)] \nprovides for differential premium rates for different categories of insured banks. The \nproposal to introduce RBP for deposit insurance has been approved by the Central \nBoard of RBI on December 19, 2025.   \n \nSalient features of the RBP framework are as under: \n\u2022 There shall be two risk assessment models \u2013 Tier 1 Model and Tier 2 Model. \nTier 1 Model is applicable to Scheduled Commercial Banks other than \nRegional Rural Banks (RRBs), and based on supervisory ratings, quantitative \nassessment (CAMELS parameters) and potential loss to Deposit Insurance \nFund (DIF) in case of failure of insured banks.  \n \n\u2022 Tier 2 Model, applicable to RRBs and cooperative banks is based on \nquantitative assessment (CAMELS parameters) and potential loss to DIF in \ncase of failure of insured banks.  \n \n\u2022 The maximum Risk_model_incentive shall be 33.33% over the card rate. \n \n\u2022 Additionally, the RBP framework also provides benefits of vintage (signifying \nlonger contribution to DICGC\u2019s Deposit Insurance Fund without any major \ndistress or claim payouts from DICGC). Maximum Vintage_incentive of upto \n25% shall be provided. \n \n\u2022 The effective rate of premium therefore will be calculated, as under:  \n \n \n\u2022 The framework envisages a rating override policy in case of adverse material \ninformation/development, subsequent to the initial risk rating. \n \n\u2022 The banks will be required to maintain confidentiality of ratings and not to \ndisclose ratings or amount of premium paid to DICGC.  \n \n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u0930\u0930\u091c\u093c\u0930\u094d\u0935 \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n\u0930\u094d\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u0935\u0930\u094d\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0935\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u0938\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0935, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0935, \u092e \u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n \n\u2022 Local Area Bank (LABs) and Payments Banks (PBs) will continue to pay the \npremium at card rate (i.e., 12 paise per \u20b9100 of AD per annum) as there are \ndata point limitations to bring them into a RBP model (they account for less \nthan 1% of the premium collected). \n \n\u2022 All UCBs under the Supervisory Action Framework (SAF)/Prompt Corrective \nAction (PCA) of RBI will continue to pay the card rate of 12 paise and will be \nconsidered for RBP from the financial year following the year in which the \nbank exits SAF/PCA. \n \n\u2022 The RBP framework shall be effective from April 1, 2026 and will be reviewed \nat least once in three years. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/2067                                      Chief General Manager \n",

    "file_extracted_text": "1 \n \nFebruary 06, 2026 \nStatement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies \n     This Statement sets out various developmental and regulatory policy measures \nrelating to (i) Regulations; (ii) Payments System; (iii) Financial Inclusion; (iv) Financial \nMarkets; and (v) Capacity Building. \n \nI. \nRegulations \n \n1. \nAdvertising, Marketing and Sales of Financial Products and Services by \nRegulated Entities (REs) \n \n     Mis-selling financial products and services by any RE has significant consequences \nfor both customers as well as the RE. There is a felt need to ensure that third party \nproducts and services that are being sold at the bank counters are suitable to customer \nneeds and are commensurate with the risk appetite of individual clients. It has \ntherefore been decided to issue comprehensive instructions to REs on advertising, \nmarketing and sales of financial products and services. The draft instructions in this \nregard shall be issued shortly for public consultation. \n \n2. \nConduct of Regulated Entities in Recovery of Loans and Engagement of \nRecovery Agents \n \n     Currently, different sets of instructions are applicable to different categories of \nRegulated Entities (REs) with respect to the engagement of recovery agents and \nconduct related aspects of loan recovery.  \n \n     It has now been decided to review and harmonise all the extant conduct related \ninstructions on engagement of recovery agents and other aspects related to recovery \nof loans. Accordingly, the draft instructions in this regard shall be issued shortly for \npublic consultation. \n \n3. \nReview of framework of Limiting Customer Liability in digital transactions \n \n     The extant instructions on limiting the liability of customers in unauthorised \nelectronic banking transactions were issued in 2017, which deal with scenarios and \ntimelines for zero / limited liability of a customer. In view of the rapid adoption of \ntechnology in the banking sector and payments systems, since issuance of these \ninstructions, the existing instructions have been reviewed. Accordingly, the draft \nrevised instructions, including a framework for compensation in case of small value \nfraudulent transactions, shall be issued shortly for public consultation. \n \n \n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n  \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u01d0\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n  \u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u036a\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0223\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0223\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u0367\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n4. \nBank Lending to Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) \n \n     Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) \nwere conceptualised in India with a view to free up banks\u2019 funds in completed and \noperational real estate and infrastructure projects by refinancing such exposures with \npooled funds of institutional as well as retail investors. Consistent with these \nobjectives, commercial banks were not permitted, ab initio, to lend to these entities. \nWhile bank lending to InvITs was allowed subsequently, lending to REITs was not \npermitted hitherto. Upon review and considering the presence of strong regulatory and \ngovernance framework for listed REITs, it is proposed to permit commercial banks to \nextend finance to REITs, subject to appropriate prudential safeguards. The existing \nguidelines in respect of lending to InvITs are also being harmonised for parity with \nprudential safeguards proposed for lending to REITs. Draft directions in this regard will \nbe issued shortly for public consultation. \n \n5. \nReview of Lending norms for UCBs  \n \n     In the recent past, several regulatory measures have been undertaken with the \nobjective of providing greater flexibility to UCBs in their lending operations. It is now \nproposed to rationalise the extant regulatory norms applicable for unsecured loans by \nUCBs; limits for lending to nominal members; and the tenor and moratorium \nrequirements for housing loans. The proposed review shall adopt inter alia, a tiered \nand simplified approach while maintaining prudential discipline, taking into \nconsideration the growth in total loans and advances of the UCBs over the past few \nyears. Draft directions in this regard will be issued shortly for public consultation.  \n \n6. \nExemption from registration to eligible NBFCs not availing public funds \nand not having customer interface (including \u2018Type I NBFCs\u2019) \n \n     The Scale-Based Regulatory Framework for NBFCs envisages differential \nregulatory treatment for NBFCs that do not avail public funds and do not have any \ncustomer interface. Given their unique nature, a review of the regulations presently \napplicable to these NBFCs has been undertaken. Considering their significantly lower \nsystemic-risk profile, it is proposed that such Type-I NBFCs with asset size not \nexceeding \u20b91,000 crore, may be exempted from registration requirement with the \nReserve Bank subject to certain specified conditions. The proposed exemption will \nreduce compliance requirements for these NBFCs. Accordingly, draft Amendment \nDirections will be issued shortly for feedback from stakeholders. \n \n7. \nAmendment of NBFC Branch Authorisation Directions-2025 \n \n     At per extant regulatory requirement, NBFC - Investment and Credit Companies \n(ICCs) engaged in the business of lending against gold collateral with over 1,000 \nbranches are required to obtain prior RBI approval for opening new branches. In view \nof the comprehensive prudential and governance framework applicable to NBFC-\nICCs, it is proposed to dispense with the requirement of prior approval for opening \nbranches by such NBFCs. The draft instructions in this regard shall be issued shortly \nseeking stakeholders\u2019 comments. \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nII. \nPayments System \n \n8. \nDiscussion Paper on \u201cExploring safeguards in digital payments to curb \nfrauds\u201d \n \n     Over the past decade, digital payments in India have expanded at an \nunprecedented pace, reflecting a structural shift in the way individuals and businesses \nconduct financial transactions. However, it has been accompanied with growing \nsophistication of fraudulent activities targeting innocent customers.  In alignment with \nthe objective of promoting digital payments in a safe and secure manner, it is proposed \nto issue a Discussion Paper exploring the introduction of calibrated safeguards in \ndigital payments such as introduction of lagged credits, additional authentication for \nspecific class of users like senior citizens, etc. The proposed measures are intended \nto mitigate frauds and strengthen customer protection. \n \nIII. \nFinancial Inclusion \n \n9. \nRevision in Lead Bank Scheme \n \n     The Reserve Bank has undertaken a detailed review of the existing guidelines on \nLead Bank Scheme (LBS). It is now proposed to issue a comprehensive set of \ninstructions on the Scheme with a view to streamline the operational aspects. In the \nrevised Scheme, the objectives of LBS and the framework to achieve them are \nproposed to be delineated clearly. The revised guidelines are expected to enhance the \neffectiveness of the Scheme. The draft Circular will be issued shortly for public \nconsultation. In addition, the Reserve Bank will be launching a unified portal for \nreporting of Bank-wise LBS data which is currently fragmented across various portals. \nThis is expected to significantly enhance the data quality and provide better insights \ntowards achieving the objectives of LBS. \n \n10. \nRevision in the Guidelines of Kisan Credit Card (KCC) \n \n     The Reserve Bank has comprehensively reviewed the KCC Scheme with a view to \nexpand \ncoverage, streamline \noperational \naspects and \naddress \nemerging \nrequirements.  It is now proposed to issue a revised set of instructions to banks on the \nScheme, consolidating those on agriculture and allied activities. The proposed \nguidelines include, among others, standardisation of crop season, extension of KCC \ntenure to six years, alignment of drawing limit with Scale of Finance (SoF) for each \ncrop season and inclusion of expenses on technological interventions. The draft \nguidelines will be issued shortly. \n \n11. \nReview of guidelines relating to use of Business Correspondents (BCs) \nby banks \n \n     Business Correspondents have been functioning as critical enablers of last mile \naccess to financial services, particularly in respect of underserved, rural, and remote \nlocations. Reserve Bank had set up a committee, consisting of officials from Reserve \nBank, DFS, IBA and NABARD, to comprehensively examine their operations and \nmake suitable recommendations for enhancing their efficiency. Basis the Committee\u2019s \nrecommendations, the related regulatory guidelines are being reviewed, and the draft \namendment directions will be placed for public consultations shortly. \n \n4 \n \n12. \nEnhancement in Collateral free loan limit from \u20b910 lakh to \u20b920 lakh \n \n     With a view to facilitate improved access to formal credit, support entrepreneurial \nactivity and strengthen last mile credit delivery for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) \nwith limited collateral, it has been decided to enhance the limit of collateral free loans \nto MSEs from \u20b910 lakh to \u20b920 lakh. The above provisions shall be applicable to all \nloans to MSE borrowers sanctioned or renewed on or after April 01, 2026. Instructions \nin this regard will be issued shortly. \n \nIV. \nFinancial Markets \n \n13. \nDevelopment of corporate bond market  \n \n     An active derivatives market can facilitate efficient management of credit risks, \nimprove liquidity and efficiency in the corporate bond market and facilitate issuance of \ncorporate bonds across the rating spectrum. An announcement was made in the Union \nBudget speech delivered on February 1, 2026, that total return swaps on corporate \nbonds and derivatives on corporate bond indices will be introduced. Accordingly, a \nregulatory framework to enable the introduction of derivatives on credit indices and \ntotal return swaps on corporate bonds will be issued shortly for public feedback. \n \n14. \nForeign Exchange Dealings of Authorised Dealers \n \n     Banks and standalone primary dealers authorised under FEMA, 1999, access the \nforeign exchange market for market making, balance sheet management and hedging \nof risks. The regulatory framework governing the facilities for such Authorised Dealers \n(ADs) has been reviewed, rationalised and refined in view of the current market \npractices and requirements, domestically and globally. The revised framework \nprovides these ADs with greater flexibility with respect to foreign exchange products, \nrisk management and platforms. Draft directions in this regard will be issued shortly \nfor public consultation. \n  \n15. \nReview of the Voluntary Retention Route for FPI investment in debt \ninstruments \n  \n     The Voluntary Retention Route (VRR) was introduced by the Reserve Bank in \nMarch 2019 to provide an additional channel for investments by Foreign Portfolio \nInvestors (FPIs) with long-term investment interest in the Indian debt markets. Over \nthe years, the Bank has been recalibrating the Route to improve operational flexibilities \nand ease of doing business. The VRR has been witnessing active investment by FPIs, \nand over 80 per cent of the current investment limit of \u20b92.5 lakh crore has been utilised. \nWith a view to ensuring predictability about the availability of investment limits under \nthe VRR and to further increase ease of doing business, it has been decided that (a) \ninvestments under the VRR shall now be reckoned under the limit for FPI investments \nunder the General Route; and (b) certain additional operational flexibilities will be \nprovided to FPIs investing under the VRR. Necessary directions will be separately \nissued.  \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nV. \nCapacity Building \n \n16. \nMission Saksham \u2013 Capacity Building for the UCB Sector  \n \n     Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs) are vital institutions for promoting \nfinancial inclusion and serving the unbanked. Securing their next phase of growth \nwould depend on developing stronger skills and competencies, along with technical \ncapabilities and operational resilience in them. To serve this objective, the Reserve \nBank will soon be launching Mission SAKSHAM (Sahakari Bank Kshamta Nirman)- a \nsector-wide capacity-building and certification framework. The capacity building of the \nsector would be implemented through a large number of physical training programmes \nas well as a scalable learning platform, to cover about 1.40 lakh participants, across \nall functions. The Reserve Bank shall endeavour to conduct these training \nprogrammes at locations close to participating UCBs, with content delivery in regional \nlanguages to the extent feasible. The Mission will be pursued in partnership with the \nUmbrella Organisation of UCBs and National / State Federations. \n \n \n                                                                                                           (Brij Raj)            \nPress Release: 2025-2026/2055                                             Chief General Manager \n \n \n",

    "file_extracted_text": "1 \n \nFebruary 06, 2026 \n \nGovernor\u2019s Statement: February 06, 2026 \n \n     Good morning. I welcome you all to the first policy of 2026. We are only in the \nsecond month of the new year and have already witnessed momentous actions on the \ngeopolitical and trade-tariff fronts.  \n \n \n  \n2. \nAmidst heightened geo-political tensions and elevated uncertainty, the Indian \neconomy is in a good spot with strong growth and low inflation. Inflation remains below \nthe tolerance band and its outlook continues to be benign. High frequency indicators \nsuggest continuation of the strong growth momentum in Q3:2025-26 and beyond. With \nthe signing of a landmark trade deal with the European Union and the US trade \nagreement in sight, growth momentum is likely to be sustained for a longer period. \n \n3. \nGlobal growth, supported by tech-investments, accommodative financial \nconditions and large-scale fiscal stimulus, is expected to be marginally stronger in \n2026 than projected earlier. However, the confluence of escalating geopolitical frictions \nand rising trade tensions is unravelling the existing world economic order.  Inflation \noutcomes are heterogeneous across jurisdictions \u2013 remaining above target in most \nmajor advanced economies \u2013 prompting a divergence in monetary policy actions as \ncentral banks near the end of their current easing cycles. Against a global backdrop \nthat has increasingly become more cautious, bond market sentiments remain bearish \nreflecting fiscal sustainability concerns. However, equity markets, driven by tech \nstocks, remain upbeat. \n \nDecisions of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) \n  \n4. \nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 4th, 5th and 6th of February \nto deliberate and decide on the policy repo rate. After a detailed assessment of the \nevolving macroeconomic conditions and the outlook, the MPC voted unanimously to \nkeep the policy repo rate unchanged at 5.25 per cent; consequently, the standing \ndeposit facility (SDF) rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) remains at 5.00 \nper cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 5.50 per \ncent. The MPC also decided to continue with the neutral stance. \n \n5. \nI shall now briefly set out the rationale for the MPC\u2019s decision. \n \n6. \nThe MPC noted that since the last policy meeting, external headwinds have \nintensified though the successful completion of trade deals augurs well for the \neconomic outlook. Overall, the near-term domestic inflation and growth outlook remain \npositive.  \n \n \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n7. \nHeadline inflation during November-December remained below the tolerance \nband of the inflation target. The revised outlook for CPI inflation in Q1:2026-27 and Q2 \nat 4.0 per cent and 4.2 per cent, respectively, continues to be benign and near the \ninflation target. The slight upward revision in the inflation outlook is primarily due to \nincrease in prices of precious metals, which contribute about 60-70 basis points. The \nunderlying inflation continues to be low. \n  \n8. \nOn the growth front, economic activity remains resilient. The First Advance \nEstimates suggest continuing growth momentum, driven by domestic factors amidst a \nchallenging external environment. The growth outlook remains favourable. \n \n9. \nBased on a comprehensive review of the domestic macroeconomic conditions \nand the outlook, the MPC is of the view that the current policy rate is appropriate. \nAccordingly, the MPC voted to continue with the existing policy rate. The MPC also \nagreed to retain the neutral stance. Going forward, the MPC will be guided by the \nevolving macroeconomic conditions and the outlook based on data from the new \nseries in charting the future course of monetary policy. \n  \nAssessment of Growth and Inflation \n  \nGrowth \n \n10. \nThe Indian economy continues on a steadily improving trajectory, with real GDP \npoised to register significantly higher growth of 7.4 per cent in 2025-26, as compared \nto the previous year. Amidst global headwinds, private consumption and fixed \ninvestment supported growth.1 Net external demand, however, remained a drag, with \nimports outpacing exports. On the supply side, growth in real GVA, on the back of a \nstrong contribution from the services sector and revival in manufacturing activity, is \nestimated at 7.3 per cent in 2025-26.2 \n  \n11. \nGoing forward, economic activity is expected to hold up well in 2026-27. \nAgricultural activity will be supported by healthy reservoir levels,3 robust rabi sowing,4 \nand improvement in crop vegetation conditions.5 Improving corporate sector \nperformance6 and sustained momentum in informal sector should boost \nmanufacturing activity. Construction sector growth is expected to remain firm.7 \n \n1 As per the first advance estimates (FAE), private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) is estimated to grow at 7.0 per cent in \n2025-26 vis-\u00e0-vis 7.2 per cent in the previous year. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) is estimated to expand strongly by 7.8 \nper cent as against 7.1 per cent growth in the last year.  \n \n2 As per the FAE of 2025-26, services sector GVA recorded a growth of 8.8 per cent and manufacturing sector GVA expanded \nby 7.0 per cent.   \n \n3 All-India reservoirs level stood at 66.6 per cent of the total capacity as on February 5, 2026, as against 61.4 per cent a year ago \nand a decadal average of 53.3 per cent. \n \n4 Rabi sowing grew by 2.4 per cent as on January 30, 2026. \n \n5 Satellite-based Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) monitored by ISRO indicates improved rabi crop vegetation health in north-\nwestern and western regions during January 2026 relative to the corresponding period last year. \n \n6 Early results from a limited set of listed private manufacturing companies indicate an increase in operating profit by 8.3 per cent \nin Q3:2025-26 (2.7 per cent in Q3:2024-25). \n \n7 Cement production growth accelerated to 11.1 percent in Q3:2025-26. \n \n3 \n \nServices sector should continue to be resilient, with strengthening domestic demand.8 \nEarly results from IT firms suggest an improvement in business activity.9 \n \n12. \nOn the demand side, the momentum in private consumption is expected to \nsustain in 2026-27. Rural demand remains steady,10 with improving agricultural activity \nand rural labour market conditions.11 Recovery in urban consumption should further \nstrengthen with continued support from GST rationalisation and monetary easing. High \ncapacity utilisation,12 accelerating bank credit,13 conducive financial conditions, and \ngovernment\u2019s continued emphasis on infrastructure14 should give an impetus to \ninvestment activity. Moreover, several measures announced in the Union Budget \nshould also be conducive for growth.15  The recently concluded India-EU free trade \nagreement (FTA) and the prospective India-USA trade deal along with several other \ntrade agreements will support exports over the medium-term. Services exports should \nremain resilient.16 The spillovers emanating from geopolitical tensions, volatility in \ninternational financial markets and shifting trade patterns pose risks to the outlook. \n  \n13. \nTaking all these factors into consideration, real GDP growth projections for \nQ1:2026-27 and Q2 are revised upwards to 6.9 per cent and 7.0 per cent, respectively \n.17  The risks are evenly balanced. We are deferring the projections for the full year to \nthe April policy as the new GDP series will be released later in the month. \n \nInflation \n \n14. \nHeadline CPI inflation remained low in November and December even as it \nfirmed up by one percentage point in these two months. This increase was largely \n \n8 Services PMI remained in a strong expansionary zone at 58.0 in December and strengthened further to 58.5 in January 2026.  \n \n9 Early results of IT companies suggest an improvement in performance, with net sales growth rising to 8.4 per cent in Q3:2025\u2013\n26 from 6.7 per cent in Q2:2025\u201326, and operating profit growth increasing to 10.3 per cent from 7.2 per cent in the previous \nquarter. Wage growth also accelerated in Q3 (from 5.6 per cent to 6.5 per cent), indicating a broad-based increase in the nominal \nGVA of IT companies. \n \n10 Two-wheeler and tractor retail sales registered double digit growth of 18.7 per cent and 28.8 per cent, respectively, in Q3: \n2025-26. \n \n11 According to the monthly periodic labour force survey (PLFS), all-India unemployment rate remained low at 4.8 per cent in \nDecember. Demand for work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) declined \nby 29.0 per cent in December. \n \n12 As per the quarterly order books, inventories, and capacity utilisation (OBICUS) survey of the RBI, seasonally adjusted capacity \nutilisation (CU) of the manufacturing sector at 74.8 per cent in Q2:2025-26 was above the long-term average of 73.9 per cent. \n \n13 Bank credit to textiles, chemicals, base metals, and engineering goods increased y-o-y by 11.8 per cent, 14.8 per cent, 14.2 \nper cent, and 30.4 per cent, respectively, in December 2025. \n \n14 The central government\u2019s capex is budgeted to expand by 11.5 per cent in 2026-27. Effective capital expenditure (including \ngrants-in-aid to state governments for capital expenditure) is budgeted to grow at 22.1 per cent. \n \n15 Major sectoral measures include (i) setting up of MSME Growth Fund, India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) 2.0, regional medical \nhubs, new Freight Corridors, Infrastructure Risk Guarantee Fund, three dedicated Chemical Parks and (ii) introduction of Scheme \nfor Enhancement of Construction and Infrastructure Equipment, Scheme for Container Manufacturing, and Integrated Programme \nfor labour intensive textile sector. \n \n16 Services export expanded sharply by 13.0 per cent in December from 6.7 per cent recorded in November 2025. \n \n17 Projections for full year 2026-27 will be set out in the Monetary Policy Statement to be announced in April 2026 after \nincorporating the new GDP and CPI series (base 2024=100) to be released on February 27 and February 12, 2026, respectively.  \n \n4 \n \ndriven by the lower rate of deflation in the food group.18 Excluding gold, core inflation \nremained stable at 2.6 per cent in December19. \n \n15. \nNear-term outlook suggests that food supply prospects remain bright on the \nback of healthy kharif production20, sufficient buffer stocks of foodgrains21, favourable \nrabi sowing and adequate reservoir levels. Core inflation, barring potential volatility \ninduced by prices of precious metals, is expected to be range-bound. Geopolitical \nuncertainty coupled with volatility in energy prices and adverse weather events pose \nupside risks to inflation. \n  \n16. \nIn terms of the headline inflation trajectory, despite the anticipated momentum \nbeing muted, unfavourable base effects stemming from large decline in prices \nobserved during Q4:2024-25 would lead to an uptick in y-o-y inflation in Q4:2025-26. \nConsidering all these factors, CPI inflation for 2025-26 is now projected at 2.1 per cent \nwith Q4 at 3.2 per cent. CPI inflation for Q1:2026-27 and Q2 are projected at 4.0 per \ncent and 4.2 per cent, respectively.  Excluding precious metals, the underlying inflation \npressures remain muted. The risks are evenly balanced. \n \n17. \nIn view of the impending release of the new CPI series (base 2024=100) on \nFebruary 12, 202622, similar to growth, we will present CPI inflation projection for the \nfull year 2026-27 in the April 2026 Policy Statement. \n \nExternal Sector \n \n18. \nDespite heightened uncertainty, global trade remained relatively robust. India\u2019s \nmerchandise exports, supported by trade diversification efforts,  grew by 1.9 per cent \n(y-o-y)  in Q3:2025-26 whereas merchandise imports grew by 7.9 per cent (y-o-y) \nduring the same period resulting in a widening of the trade deficit.23 Robust services \nexports24 and healthy inward remittance receipts25 would keep India\u2019s current account \ndeficit for the current year moderate and sustainable. Moreover, India\u2019s proactive \nefforts in pursuing bilateral and regional trade agreements with major trading partners \nare expected to boost international trade and investment, diversify trading partners \nand integrate India into global value chains.26 \n \n18 Food group registered a deflation of (-) 1.8 per cent in December 2025 on a y-o-y basis, narrowing from (-) 3.7 per cent and (-\n) 2.8 per cent in October and November respectively. Within food group, vegetables, pulses, and spices recorded a deflation of \n(-) 18.5 per cent, (-) 15.1 per cent and (-) 2.2 per cent, respectively, albeit at a slower rate. \n \n19 Core inflation hardened to 4.6 per cent in December from 4.3 per cent during October-November, owing to a surge in gold \nprices. Gold inflation (over 50 per cent y-o-y since October 2025) contributed disproportionately to headline and core numbers. \n \n20 As per the First Advance Estimates of agricultural production, kharif foodgrains in 2025-26 is estimated to be 2.3 per cent \nhigher than the final estimates of 2024-25. \n \n21 As on January 16, 2026, the rice and wheat stock stood at 731 lakh tonnes (9.6 times the buffer norm) and 269 lakh tonnes \n(1.9 times the buffer norm), respectively. \n \n22 The new series is likely to incorporate methodological changes, improved data collection and revised weights based on the \nHCES 2023-24. \n  \n23 As India\u2019s merchandise imports grew faster than merchandise exports, trade deficit rose to US$ 91.5 billion in Q3:2025-26 from \nUS$ 88.0 billion in Q2:2025-26 and US$ 78.7 billion in Q3:2024-25.  \n24 During Q3:2025-26, services exports at US$ 111.2 billion grew at 7.5 per cent y-o-y, while services imports at US$ 53.7 billion \nexpanded by 2.7 per cent. Net services exports grew by 12.3 per cent y-o-y and stood at US$ 57.5 billion during the same period.  \n25 India\u2019s inward remittances increased by 10.7 per cent y-o-y to US$ 39.0 billion in Q2:2025-26. \n26 Trade deals with the UK and Oman have been signed; trade deal with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) came into \neffect from October 1, 2025; trade deals with New Zealand and the European Union have been concluded; and trade deal with \nthe US has been announced. \n \n5 \n \n    \n19. \nOn the external financing side, gross foreign direct investment (FDI) to India \nincreased at a robust pace during April-November 2025. Net FDI also increased as  \nrepatriations declined, despite a rise in outward FDI.27 India continues to remain an \nattractive FDI destination for greenfield projects.28 Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) \nto India this year so far (April- February 3)29, however, recorded net outflows of US$ \n5.8 billion. As on 30th January, 2026, India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ \n723.8 billion, providing a robust merchandise import cover of more than 11 months. \nOverall, India\u2019s external sector remains resilient.30 We are confident of meeting our \nexternal financing requirements comfortably. \n \nLiquidity and Financial Market Conditions \n \n20. \nSystem liquidity, as measured by the net position under the Liquidity \nAdjustment Facility (LAF), stood at a surplus of \u20b90.7 lakh crore (on a daily average \nbasis) since the last MPC meeting in December 2025.31 The Reserve Bank undertook \nseveral measures to provide durable liquidity in December and January32. Based on \nassessment of systemic liquidity and its outlook, the Reserve Bank announced and \nundertook further durable liquidity augmenting measures in the second half of January \nand February 2026.33 \n \n21. \nIn response to the cumulative 125 bps cut in the policy repo rate, the weighted \naverage lending rate (WALR) of Scheduled Commercial Banks declined by 105 bps \nfor fresh rupee loans during February-December 2025 (the interest rate effect34 is 94 \nbps)35. The weighted average domestic term deposit rate (WADTDR) on fresh \ndeposits declined by 95 bps, while that on outstanding deposits softened by 41 bps \nover the same period. \n  \n \n27 Gross foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to India grew by 16.1 per cent to US$ 64.7 billion in April-November 2025-26 from \nUS$ 55.8 billion a year ago. Net FDI inflows stood higher at US$ 5.6 billion during April- November 2025-26 from US$ 0.8 billion \na year ago. \n28 During 2025-26 (April-November), greenfield project announcements to India stood at US$ 56 billion, marginally lower than \nUS$ 63 billion a year ago. Top 5 FDI announcements during the year have been by the Amazon, Microsoft, Google, MUFG Bank \nand Hynfra, which augurs well for FDI inflows, going forward. \n    \n29 During 2025-26 (April-February 3), FPI to India recorded net outflows to the tune of US$ 7.5 billion from the equity segment, \nwhile debt segment registered net inflows of US$ 1.7 billion. \n   \n30 India\u2019s external debt to GDP ratio rose marginally to 19.2 per cent at end-September 2025 from 19.1 per cent at end-March \n2025, while the net international investment position (IIP) moderated to (-) 7.2 per cent of GDP at end-September 2025 from (-) \n8.6 per cent of GDP at end-March 2025. \n31 The average daily net absorption under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) during October and November stood at \u20b90.9 lakh \ncrore and \u20b91.9 lakh crore, respectively. The average daily net absorption under the LAF declined to \u20b90.8 lakh crore in December \n2025 and January 2026. In February 2026 (up to February 4), average daily net absorption under the LAF increased to \u20b91.8 lakh \ncrore. \n32 The Reserve Bank conducted OMO purchase auctions amounting to \u20b93,50,000 crore and long-term forex buy/sell swap auction \nof USD 15.1 billion in December 2025 and January 2026.  \n33 The Reserve Bank conducted additional OMO purchase auctions amounting to \u20b91,00,000 crore, long term forex buy/sell swaps \nof USD 10 billion, 90-day VRR operation of \u20b925,000 crore and a second 90-day VRR operation of \u20b91,11,500 crore for January \nand February 2026. \n34 Interest rate effect on transmission to weighted average lending rate (WALR) is calculated by keeping the weight constant (as \nof January 2025). \n35 The moderation in the weighted average lending rate (WALR) of outstanding rupee loans has been to the extent of 81 bps. \nTransmission has been broad-based across sectors. \n6 \n \n22. \nMoney market rates, especially for commercial papers (CPs) and certificates of \ndeposit (CDs), tightened in January 2026 reflecting (i) moderation in surplus liquidity; \n(ii) excess supply from bunching of redemptions in CPs and CDs in January; and (iii) \nyear-end seasonal effects.36 G-sec yields, mirroring global trends, have continued to \nharden over the last eight months37 due to a host of factors. \n \n23. \nGoing ahead, the Reserve Bank will remain proactive in liquidity management \nand ensure sufficient liquidity in the banking system to meet the productive \nrequirements of the economy and to facilitate monetary policy transmission. Liquidity \nmanagement would be pre-emptive with sufficient allowance for unanticipated \nfluctuations in government balances, changes in currency in circulation, forex \nintervention, etc. \n \nFinancial Stability \n \n24. \nThe system-level financial parameters related to capital adequacy, liquidity, \nasset quality and profitability of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) continue to \nremain robust.38 Similarly, the system-level parameters of NBFCs too are sound, with \nadequate capital position and improved asset quality39. \n \n25. \nAs per latest available data, credit from all sources grew at 13.8 per cent (y-o-\ny), as compared to 11.6 per cent (y-o-y) a year ago40. Bank credit growth too recorded \nan uptick in recent months.41 This growth42 is supported by sustained lending to all \nsectors, particularly retail, services and MSMEs. Large industries also recorded higher \ncredit growth. \n \n \n36 In response to the cumulative policy repo rate cut of 125 basis points (bps) in the current easing cycle, the WACR, the 3-month \nT-bill rate, the 3-month CP issued by NBFCs, and the 3-month CD rate declined by 89 bps, 119 bps, 143 bps, and 127 bps, \nrespectively up to end-December, 2025. However, since the beginning of January and up to February 4, 2026, the 3-month T-bill \nrate, the 3-month CP issued by NBFCs, and the 3-month CD rate have hardened by 6 bps, 73 bps and 84 bps, respectively. \n37 The 10-year G-sec yield hardened to 6.65 per cent as on February 5, 2026 from 6.51 per cent as on December 4, 2025.  \n38 SCB Parameters: The outstanding credit and deposits increased by 14.54 per cent and 12.68 per cent on a y-o-y basis, \nrespectively, between December 2024 and December 2025. The system-level Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of \n17.24 per cent in September 2025 was well above the regulatory minimum level. There was continued improvement in asset \nquality with the GNPA and NNPA ratios at 2.05 per cent and 0.47 per cent  respectively in September 2025 vis-\u00e0-vis 2.54 per \ncent and 0.48 per cent in September 2024. Liquidity buffers were robust, with an LCR of 131.68 per cent as of end September \n2025. The annualised return on assets (RoA) and return on equity (RoE) stood at 1.32 per cent and 13.06 per cent, respectively, \nin September 2025. Net Interest Margin was 3.26 per cent for September 2025 (3.52 per cent in September 2024).  \n \n39 NBFC Parameters: Total CRAR of NBFCs was 25.11 per cent and Tier I CRAR was 23.27 per cent in September 2025, well \nabove the minimum regulatory requirements. GNPA ratio has improved from 2.57 per cent in September 2024 to 2.21 per cent \nin September 2025, while NNPA ratio also improved from 1.04 per cent in September 2024 to 0.99 per cent in September 2025. \nRoA for the sector decreased slightly from 3.25 per cent in September 2024 to 2.83 per cent in September 2025. NIM has slightly \ndecreased from 5.51% in September 2024 to 4.24 per cent in September 2025.  \n \n40 The total flow of resources from bank and non-bank sources to the commercial sector stood higher at \u20b929.6 lakh crore in 2025-\n26 so far as compared to \u20b923.3 lakh crore in the corresponding period of the previous financial year. The increase in flows from \nnon-food bank credit (\u20b95.04 lakh crore) and corporate bond issuances by non-financial entities (\u20b91.4 lakh crore) have been the \nmajor drivers of this growth.  \n \n41 On a year-on-year basis, bank credit registered a growth of 13.1 per cent as on January 15, 2026, compared to 11.5 per cent \na year ago. During the same period, deposit growth at 10.6 per cent was lower than 10.8 per cent a year ago. During 2025-26 \n(up to January 15, 2026), the incremental credit to deposit (C/D) ratio was placed at 98.4. \n \n42 Sectoral non-food credit data are based on sector-wise and industry-wise bank credit (SIBC) return, which covers select banks \naccounting for about 95 per cent of total non-food credit extended by all SCBs, pertaining to the last reporting Friday of the month. \nData available till December 2025. Effective December 31, 2025, definition of last reporting fortnight has been changed to the \nlast day of the month under the Banking Laws (Amendment) Act 2025. Accordingly, the y-o-y growth rates from December 2025 \nonwards are based on end-of-month data for the current year and data for the last reporting fortnight (as per old definition) for \nthe corresponding month of the previous year. \n \n7 \n \n \n \nAdditional Measures \n \n26. \nI shall now announce some measures that aim to enhance customer protection, \nadvance financial inclusion, enhance flow of credit, strengthen UCBs, promote ease \nof doing business for NBFCs, and deepen financial markets. \n \nEmpowering customers \n  \n27. \nFor customer protection, we will issue three draft guidelines: one, relating to \nmis-selling; two, regarding recovery of loans and engagement of recovery agents; and \nthree, on limiting liability of customers in un-authorised electronic banking \ntransactions. It is also proposed to introduce a framework to compensate customers \nup to an amount of \u20b925000/- for loss incurred in small-value fraudulent transactions. \n \n28. \nWe will also publish a discussion paper on possible measures to enhance the \nsafety of digital payments. Such measures may include lagged credits and additional \nauthentication for specific class of users like senior citizens. \n \nAdvancing financial inclusion and flow of credit \n \n29. \nIn the financial inclusion space, we have comprehensively reviewed the Lead \nBank Scheme, Kisan Credit Card Scheme and the Business Correspondent Model. \nWe shall issue draft revised guidelines with respect to them. A unified reporting portal \nwill also be launched by us for better management of LBS data. \n \n30. \nThe limit of \u20b910 lakh for collateral-free loans to MSMEs is proposed to be \nincreased to \u20b920 lakh. \n \n31. \nTo further promote financing to real estate sector, it is proposed to allow banks \nto lend to REITs with certain prudential safeguards. \n \nStrengthening UCBs \n \n32. \nWe have four measures for UCBs. \n  \n33. \nThe first two pertain to raising the financial limits on unsecured loans and loans \nto nominal members by UCBs. \n  \n34. \nWe also propose to remove the tenor and moratorium related requirements on \nhousing loans given by Tier III and Tier IV UCBs. \n \n35. \nTo strengthen the managerial and technical capacity of the UCBs, we shall \nlaunch Mission-SAKSHAM (Sahakari Bank Kshamta Nirman). The mission intends to \ntrain over 1.4 lakh participants from UCBs. \n \nPromoting Ease of doing business for NBFCs \n \n36. \nNBFCs having no public funds and customer interface, with asset size not \nexceeding \u20b91000 crore, are proposed to be exempted from the requirement of \nregistration. \n8 \n \n \n37. \nMoreover, it is proposed to dispense with the requirement for certain NBFCs to \nobtain prior approval to open more than 1000 branches. \n \nDeepening financial markets \n  \n38. \nComing to financial markets, we had earlier issued revised draft regulations for \nECBs. They have been finalized and shall be notified shortly. \n  \n39. \nWe also propose to remove the limit of \u20b92.5 lakh crore for investments under \nthe Voluntary Retention Route (VRR). Investment through the VRR in each category \nof securities will be subject to the investment ceiling for the respective category under \nthe General Route. \n  \n40. \nFurthermore, in pursuance of the announcement made in the Union Budget \n2026-27, we propose to issue the regulatory framework for derivatives on corporate \nbond indices and total return swaps on corporate bonds. \n \n41. \nIt is also proposed to issue draft revised guidelines for Authorised Dealer banks \nand stand-alone primary dealers (SPDs), allowing them more flexibility in undertaking \nforeign exchange transactions. \n \nConcluding Remarks \n \n42. \nBefore I conclude, I would like to inform that the Reserve Bank observes \nFinancial Literacy Week (FLW) every year on specific themes of financial education. \nThe campaign this year will be launched on 9th February. In continuation of our ongoing \nendeavour on re-KYC of bank accounts, the theme this year is \u2018KYC \u2013 Your First Step \nto Safe Banking\u2019. I urge all banks to actively take part in the campaign. \n \n43. \nTo conclude, the Indian economy continues to register high growth despite a \nchallenging external environment clouded by geo-political uncertainties. Benign \ninflation provides the leeway to remain growth-supportive while preserving financial \nstability. We remain committed to meet the productive requirements of the economy \nand sustain the growth momentum. \n  \n44. \nThank you. Namaskar and Jai Hind. \n \n \n                                                                                                         (Brij Raj)             \nPress Release: 2025-2026/2054                                             Chief General Manager \n",

The MPC members Dr. Nagesh Kumar, Shri Saugata Bhattacharya, Prof. Ram \nSingh, Dr. Poonam Gupta and Shri Indranil Bhattacharyya attended the meeting. \n \n2. \n After a detailed assessment of the evolving macroeconomic and financial \ndevelopments and the outlook, the MPC voted unanimously to keep the policy repo \nrate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 5.25 per cent. \nConsequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains at 5.00 per cent and \nthe marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate remains at 5.50 per cent. \nThe MPC also decided to continue with the neutral stance.  \n \nGrowth and Inflation Outlook \n \n3. \nThe global economy showed remarkable resilience in 2025, aided and \nsupported by trade front-loading, a milder-than-anticipated impact of tariffs, broad \nfiscal stimulus and accommodative monetary policy. Inflation is on a path of gradual \ndecline, although it remains above target in several advanced economies. US yields \nare trading with an upward bias amidst receding expectations of imminent rate cuts \nunderpinned by firm economic data. Equities, supported by sustained investment in \ntech stocks, have advanced, even as fiscal strains, geopolitical uncertainty and \nmonetary policy divergence continue to impart volatility to financial markets. \n \n4. \nOn the domestic front, real gross domestic product (GDP), as per the First \nAdvance Estimates (FAE), is estimated to grow at 7.4 per cent (y-o-y) in 2025-26. \nPrivate consumption and fixed investment contributed significantly to overall growth. \nNet external demand, however, continued to be a drag, with imports outpacing \nexports. On the supply side, real GVA growth of 7.3 per cent is driven by buoyant \nservices sector, resilient agricultural sector and revival in manufacturing activity. \n \n5. \nLooking ahead, sustained buoyancy in services sector, GST rationalisation, \nhealthy rabi prospects, monetary easing and benign inflation environment should \nsupport private consumption. Investment activity, supported by high capacity \nutilisation, conducive financial conditions, healthy balance sheets of financial \ninstitutions and corporates, robust credit growth and Government\u2019s continued thrust \n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u036a\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0223\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0223\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u0367\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \non capital expenditure, is expected to maintain its momentum. Moreover, robust \ndomestic demand is likely to attract fresh investments by the private sector. While \nservices exports are expected to remain strong, merchandise exports will get a boost \nfrom the prospective trade deal with the US. The landmark  comprehensive trade pact \nwith the European Union coupled with  trade deals with New Zealand and Oman \nshould help diversify exports and strengthen the external sector. On the other hand, \nheadwinds from geopolitical tensions, uncertain global trade environment, volatility in \nglobal financial markets and international commodity prices continue to pose downside \nrisks to the outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration, real GDP growth \nprojections for Q1:2026-27 and Q2 are revised upwards to 6.9 per cent and 7.0 per \ncent, respectively (Chart 1).1  The risks are evenly balanced. \n \n6. \nHeadline CPI inflation remained low at 0.7 per cent in November and 1.3 per \ncent in December, 2025. While food group continued to be in deflation, inflation within \nthe fuel group remained moderate in November and December. Core inflation (CPI \nexcluding food and fuel)  too remained benign, despite the pick up in prices of precious \nmetals. Excluding gold, core inflation remained stable at 2.6 per cent in December. \n \n7. \nNear-term outlook suggests that food supply prospects remain bright on the \nback of healthy kharif production, adequate buffer stocks of foodgrains and favourable \nrabi sowing. Core inflation, barring potential volatility induced by prices of precious \nmetals, is expected to be range-bound. Geopolitical uncertainty coupled with volatility \nin energy prices and adverse weather events are other possible upside risks to \ninflation. In terms of headline inflation trajectory, unfavourable base effects stemming \nfrom large decline in prices observed in Q4:2024-25 would lead to an uptick in y-o-y \ninflation in Q4:2025-26, despite the anticipated momentum being muted. Considering \nall these factors, CPI inflation for 2025-26 is now projected at 2.1 per cent with Q4 at \n3.2 per cent. CPI inflation for Q1:2026-27 and Q2 are projected at 4.0 per cent and \n4.2 per cent, respectively (Chart 2).  Excluding precious metals, the underlying inflation \npressures remain muted. The risks are evenly balanced. \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n1 Projections for full year 2026-27 will be set out in the Monetary Policy Resolution to be \nannounced in April 2026 after incorporating the new GDP and CPI series (base 2024=100) to \nbe released on February 27 and February 12, 2026, respectively.  \n3 \n \n \nRationale for Monetary Policy Decisions \n \n8. \nThe MPC noted that since the last policy meeting, external headwinds have \nintensified though the successful completion of trade deals augurs well for the \neconomic outlook. Overall, the near-term domestic inflation and growth outlook remain \npositive.  \n \n9. \nHeadline inflation during November-December remained below the tolerance \nband of the inflation target. The outlook for CPI inflation in Q1:2026-27 and Q2 \ncontinues to be benign and near the inflation target. The slight upward revision in the \ninflation outlook is primarily due to increase in prices of precious metals, which \ncontribute about 60-70 basis points. The underlying inflation continues to be low. \n  \n10. \nOn the growth front, economic activity remains resilient. The First Advance \nEstimates suggest continuing growth momentum, driven by domestic factors amidst a \nchallenging external environment. The growth outlook remains favourable. \n   \n11. \nBased on a comprehensive review of the domestic macroeconomic conditions \nand the outlook, the MPC is of the view that the current policy rate is appropriate. \nAccordingly, the MPC voted to continue with the existing policy rate. The MPC also \nagreed to retain the neutral stance. However, Prof. Ram Singh retained his view that \nthe stance be changed from neutral to accommodative. Going forward, the MPC will \nbe guided by the evolving macroeconomic conditions and the outlook based on data \nfrom the new series in charting the future course of monetary policy. \n  \n12. \nThe minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on February 20, 2026. \n \n13. \nThe next meeting of the MPC is scheduled for April 6 - 8, 2026. \n \n \n \n                             \n   (Brij Raj)        \nPress Release: 2025-2026/2053                                                      Chief General Manager \n \n",

Based on supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice \nwas issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be \nimposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the \nbank\u2019s reply to the notice and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, \nRBI found, inter alia, that the following charge against the bank was sustained, \nwarranting imposition of monetary penalty:  \n \n     The bank had failed to submit credit information of its customers to any of the \nCredit Information Companies (CICs). \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers. Further, imposition of monetary penalty is without prejudice \nto any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                     (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/2051                                             Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

This penalty has been imposed in \nexercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section 58G(1)(b) read \nwith Section 58B(5)(aa) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.  \n \n     The correspondence between RBI and the company revealed, inter alia, non-\ncompliance with RBI directions. Based on the same, a notice was issued to the \ncompany advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for \nits failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the company\u2019s reply to \nthe notice and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter \nalia, that the following charge against the company was sustained, warranting \nimposition of monetary penalty: \n \n     The company had failed to obtain prior written permission of RBI for change in \nshareholding in excess of 26 per cent of its paid-up equity capital. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \ncompany with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the company. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                    (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/2046                                           Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
