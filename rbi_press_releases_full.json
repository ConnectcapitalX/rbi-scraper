    "file_extracted_text": "September 05, 2025 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on The Rohika Central Co-operative Bank Limited, Bihar \n \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated September 02, 2025, imposed a \nmonetary penalty of \u20b95.50 lakh (Rupees Five Lakh Fifty Thousand only) on The Rohika Central \nCo-operative Bank Limited, Bihar (the bank) for contravention of provisions of Section 9 read \nwith Section 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (BR Act) and non-compliance with certain \ndirections issued by RBI on \u2018Membership of Credit Information Companies (CICs) by Co-\noperative Banks\u2019 and \u2018Know Your Customer (KYC)\u2019. This penalty has been imposed in \nexercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read with \nSections 46(4)(i) and 56 of the BR Act and Section 25 read with Section 23 of the Credit \nInformation Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by National Bank for Agriculture and \nRural Development (NABARD), with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2024. \nBased on supervisory findings of contravention of statutory provisions / non-compliance with \nRBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the bank \nadvising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure to comply \nwith the said provisions and directions. After considering the bank\u2019s reply to the notice and \noral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the following \ncharges against the bank were sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty:  \n \nThe bank had failed to: \n \ni. \ndispose of certain Non-Banking Assets within the prescribed period; \n \nii. \nsubmit credit information of its customers to all the four Credit Information \nCompanies; and \niii. \nupload KYC records of customers onto Central KYC Records Registry (CKYCR) \nwithin the prescribed timeline. \n \n     This action is based on deficiency in regulatory compliance and is not intended to \npronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank with its \ncustomers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without prejudice to any other action \nthat may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n                                                                                                              (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1046                                                       Chief General Manager \n \n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n \n  \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u01d0\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n  \u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u036a\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0223\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0223\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u0367\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

    "file_extracted_text": " \n September 04, 2025 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on The Dakshin Dinajpur District Central Co-\noperative Bank Limited, West Bengal \n \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated September 02, 2025, \nimposed a monetary penalty of \u20b95.50 lakh (Rupees Five Lakh Fifty Thousand only) \non The Dakshin Dinajpur District Central Co-operative Bank Limited, West Bengal \n(the bank) for non-compliance with certain directions issued by RBI on \u2018Know Your \nCustomer (KYC)\u2019. This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on \nRBI under provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read with Sections 46(4)(i) and 56 of the \nBanking Regulation Act, 1949.   \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by the National Bank for \nAgriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) with reference to its financial position \nas on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-compliance with RBI \ndirections and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the bank \nadvising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure \nto comply with the said directions. After considering the bank\u2019s reply to the notice and \noral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the \nfollowing charges against the bank were sustained, warranting imposition of \nmonetary penalty:  \n \nThe bank had failed to: \ni) put in place a system of periodic review of risk categorisation of accounts, with \nsuch periodicity being at least once in six months; and \nii) upload the KYC records of customers onto Central KYC Records Registry \n(CKYCR) within the prescribed timeline. \n \n     This action is based on deficiency in regulatory compliance and is not intended to \npronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank \nwith its customers.

This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI \nunder the provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) and Section 46(4)(i) read with Section 56 of \nthe BR Act. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by the National Bank for \nAgriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), with reference to its financial position \nas on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-compliance with \nstatutory provisions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued \nto the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it \nfor its failure to comply with the said provisions. After considering the bank's reply to \nthe notice, additional submissions and oral submissions made during the personal \nhearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charge against the bank was \nsustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: \n \n     The bank had failed to transfer eligible unclaimed amounts to the Depositor \nEducation and Awareness Fund within the prescribed time. \n  \n     This action is based on deficiencies in statutory compliance and is not intended to \npronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank \nwith its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without prejudice to \nany other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n             (Puneet Pancholy)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1019                                           Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
