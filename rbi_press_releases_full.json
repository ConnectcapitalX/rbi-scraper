This penalty has been \nimposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section \n47A(1)(c) read with Sections 46(4)(i) and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by the National Bank for \nAgriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), with reference to its financial position \nas on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-compliance with RBI \ndirections and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the bank \nadvising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure \nto comply with the said directions. After considering the bank's reply to the notice, \noral submissions made during the personal hearing and additional submissions made \nby it, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charges against the bank were \nsustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: \n \nThe bank: \n \ni) (a) did not upload the KYC records of certain customers onto Central KYC Records  \nRegistry (CKYCR) within the prescribed timeline,  \n (b) did not carry out periodic updation of KYC of certain customers as per the \nprescribed periodicity; and \n \nii) allotted multiple customer identification codes to certain individual customers, \ninstead of a Unique Customer Identification Code (UCIC) for each individual \ncustomer. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers.

    "file_extracted_text": " \n June 30, 2025 \n \nRBI releases the Financial Stability Report, June 2025 \n    \n     Today, the Reserve Bank released the June 2025 issue of the Financial Stability \nReport (FSR), which reflects the collective assessment of the Sub-Committee of the \nFinancial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) on the resilience of the Indian \nfinancial system and risks to financial stability. \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 \nElevated economic and trade policy uncertainties are testing the resilience of \nthe global economy and the financial system. \n\u2022 \nFinancial markets remain volatile, especially core government bond markets, \ndriven by shifting policy and geopolitical environment. Alongside, existing \nvulnerabilities such as soaring public debt levels and elevated asset valuations \nhave the potential to amplify fresh shocks. \n\u2022 \nDespite an uncertain and challenging global economic backdrop, the Indian \neconomy remains a key driver of global growth, underpinned by sound \nmacroeconomic fundamentals and prudent macroeconomic policies. \n\u2022 \nThe domestic financial system is exhibiting resilience fortified by healthy \nbalance sheets of banks and non-banks. Financial conditions have eased \nsupported by accommodative monetary policy and low volatility in financial \nmarkets. The strength of the corporate balance sheets also lends support to \noverall macroeconomic stability. \n\u2022 \nThe soundness and resilience of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) are \nbolstered by robust capital buffers, multi-decadal low non-performing loans \nratio and strong earnings.  \n\u2022 \nResults of macro stress tests affirm that most SCBs have adequate capital \nbuffers relative to the regulatory minimum even under adverse stress \nscenarios. Stress tests also validate the resilience of mutual funds and \nclearing corporations. \n\u2022 \nNon-banking financial companies (NBFCs) remain healthy with sizable capital \nbuffers, robust earnings and improving asset quality. \n\u2022 \nThe consolidated solvency ratio of the insurance sector also remains above \nthe minimum threshold limit. \n \n \n \n          (Puneet Pancholy)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/624                                          Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

The major \ndevelopments relating to India\u2019s external debt as at end-March 2025 are presented \nbelow. \n \nHighlights \n\u2022 At end-March 2025, India\u2019s external debt was placed at US$ 736.3 billion, an \nincrease of US$ 67.5 billion over its level at end-March 2024 (Table 1).  \n \n\u2022 The external debt to GDP ratio increased to 19.1 per cent at end-March 2025 \nfrom 18.5 per cent at end-March 2024. \n \n\u2022 Valuation effect due to the appreciation of the US dollar vis-\u00e0-vis the Indian rupee \nand other currencies amounted to US$ 5.3 billion. Excluding the valuation effect, \nexternal debt would have increased by US$ 72.9 billion instead of US$ 67.5 billion \nat end-March 2025 over end-March 2024. \n \n\u2022 At end-March 2025, long-term debt (with original maturity of above one year) was \nplaced at US$ 601.9 billion, recording an increase of US$ 60.6 billion over its level \nat end-March 2024.  \n \n\u2022 The share of short-term debt (with original maturity of up to one year) in total \nexternal debt declined to 18.3 per cent at end-March 2025 from 19.1 per cent at \nend-March 2024. However, the ratio of short-term debt (original maturity) to \nforeign exchange reserves increased to 20.1 per cent at end-March 2025 (19.7 \nper cent at end-March 2024).  \n \n\u2022 Short-term debt on residual maturity basis (i.e., debt obligations that include long-\nterm debt by original maturity falling due over the next twelve months and short-\nterm debt by original maturity) constituted 41.2 per cent of total external debt at \nend-March 2025 (43.4 per cent at end-March 2024) and stood at 45.4 per cent of \nforeign exchange reserves (44.9 per cent at end-March 2024) (Table 2).  \n \n\u2022 US dollar-denominated debt remained the largest component of India\u2019s external \ndebt, with a share of 54.2 per cent at end-March 2025, followed by debt \ndenominated in the Indian rupee (31.1 per cent), yen (6.2 per cent), SDR2 (4.6 \nper cent), and euro (3.2 per cent). \n \n \n1 The concepts set out in the IMF\u2019s 2013 External Debt Statistics (EDS) Guide are harmonized with \nthose of the System of National Accounts (SNA) 2008 and the sixth edition of the IMF\u2019s Balance of \nPayments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) published in 2009. \n2 SDR: Special Drawing Rights. \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n\u2022 Outstanding debt of both government and non-government sectors increased at \nend-March 2025 over the level a year ago (Table 3). \n \n\u2022 The share of outstanding debt of non-financial corporations in total external debt \nwas the highest at 35.5 per cent, followed by deposit-taking corporations (except \nthe central bank) (27.5 per cent), general government (22.9 per cent) and other \nfinancial corporations (9.4 per cent). \n \n\u2022 Loans remained the largest component of external debt, with a share of 34.0 per \ncent, followed by currency and deposits (22.8 per cent), trade credit and \nadvances (17.8 per cent) and debt securities (17.7 per cent) (Table 4). \n  \n\u2022 Debt service (i.e., principal repayments and interest payments) marginally \ndeclined to 6.6 per cent of current receipts at end-March 2025 from 6.7 per cent at \nend-March 2024 (Table 5). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/614                                               Chief General Manager \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nTable 1: External Debt \u2013 Outstanding and Variation \n(US$ billion, unless indicated otherwise) \nSector \nOutstanding as at  \nend-March \nAbsolute \nVariation \nPercentage \nVariation \n2023 \nR \n2024 \nPR \n2025 \nP \nMarch \n2024 \nover \nMarch \n2023 \nMarch \n2025 \nover \nMarch \n2024 \nMarch \n2024 \nover \nMarch \n2023 \nMarch \n2025 \nover \nMarch \n2024 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \nI.
