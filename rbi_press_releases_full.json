While three of these amendments come into effect \nimmediately (Part A), public comments are solicited on the other four (Part B).  \nDetails of the proposals are given below. \nA. Directions which come into force from October 01, 2025 \n1. Reserve Bank of India (Interest Rate on Advances) (Amendment \nDirections), 2025 \n     In terms of the extant Reserve Bank of India (Interest Rate on Advances) \nDirections, 2016 dated March 3, 2016, scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) are \nrequired to benchmark all floating rate personal or retail loans (housing, auto, \netc.), and floating rate loans extended to MSMEs, to an external benchmark. \nWhile banks are free to decide the spread over the external benchmark, other \nthan credit risk premium, all components of the spread can be altered only once \nin three years. Further, in respect of Equated Monthly Instalments (EMI) based \nPersonal Loans, the Circular on Reset of Floating Interest Rate on EMI based \nPersonal Loans dated August 18, 2023, requires the regulated entities to provide \na mandatory option to the borrowers, at the time of reset of interest rates, to \nswitch over to a fixed rate.  \n     Vide the above Amendment Directions, it is proposed to revise the above \nprovisions to benefit the borrowers, while providing greater flexibility to the \nlenders.  \n(i) Banks may reduce the other spread components for the benefit of the \nborrower earlier than three years; \n \n \n \n2 \n(ii) Banks may, at their discretion, provide the option to switchover to fixed rate \nat the time of reset at their discretion. \n2. Reserve Bank of India (Lending Against Gold and Silver Collateral) - \n(1st Amendment) Directions, 2025 \n     Banks are generally prohibited from lending for purchase of gold/silver in any \nform, or lending against the security of primary gold/silver. However, a carve-out \nhas been allowed for scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) for granting working \ncapital loans to jewellers.  \nVide the proposed Amendment Directions, it is proposed to: \n(i) \nExtend the carve-out for granting any need-based working capital \nrequirements of a borrower that uses gold as a raw material or input in \nits manufacturing or industrial processing activities.  \n(ii) \nPermit Tier 3 and Tier 4 Urban Co-operative Banks to also grant \nworking capital loans, on the same lines as proposed for SCBs. \n     The above instructions shall be duly incorporated under the Reserve Bank of \nIndia (Lending Against Gold and Silver Collateral) Directions, 2025. \n3. Reserve Bank of India (Basel III Capital Regulations - Perpetual Debt \nInstruments (PDI) in Additional Tier 1 Capital \u2013 Eligible Limit for \nInstruments Denominated in Foreign Currency/Rupee Denominated \nBonds Overseas) Directions, 2025 \n     The \nReserve \nBank \nhad \nissued \na \ncircular \nDOR.CAP.REC.No.56/21.06.201/2021-22 dated October 4, 2021 on \u201cBasel III \nCapital Regulations - Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI) in Additional Tier 1 \nCapital \u2013 Eligible Limit for Instruments Denominated in Foreign Currency/Rupee \nDenominated Bonds Overseas\u201d, applicable to Scheduled Commercial Banks \n(excluding Regional Rural Banks), which specifies the eligible limit for PDIs \ndenominated in foreign currency/rupee denominated bonds overseas. The said \ninstructions have also been incorporated in sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph 1.16 \nof Annex 4 to the Master Circular DOR.CAP.REC.2/21.06.201/2025-26 dated \nApril 1, 2025 on \u201cBasel III Capital Regulations\u201d.  \n \n \n \n3 \n     The Reserve Bank has today released the \u201cReserve Bank of India (Basel III \nCapital Regulations - Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI) in Additional Tier 1 \nCapital \u2013 Eligible Limit for Instruments Denominated in Foreign Currency/Rupee \nDenominated Bonds Overseas) Directions, 2025\u201d, which revises the existing \neligible limit applicable to PDIs denominated in foreign currency/rupee \ndenominated bonds overseas, thereby providing greater headroom to banks for \naugmenting their Tier 1 capital via overseas markets. \nB. Directions/Circulars which are being issued as drafts for public \nfeedback  \n4.  Reserve Bank of India (Gold Metal Loans) Directions, 2025 \n     The Gold Metal Loan (GML) scheme was introduced vide circular on \u2018Gold \nLoan\u2019 dated December 31, 1998 to facilitate working capital finance to jewellery \nexporters in the form of raw gold imported by banks. The scheme has been \nliberalised over the years by, inter alia, allowing banks to extend GML to domestic \njewellery manufacturers and also from the gold deposits mobilised under the Gold \nMonetization Scheme. \n     With a view to further liberalise the scheme, harmonize the extant regulations \napplicable across eligible borrower segments in jewellery industry and provide \nmore operational freedom to banks to devise their GML policy, a draft of \ncomprehensive set of Directions on GML is being issued. The draft Directions, \napart from making the same more principle-based, cover the following key \nmodifications in the existing GML scheme: \n(i) Banks may fix a repayment tenor for GML extended to jewellers other than \nexporters, subject to a revised ceiling of 270 days (from current 180 days); \n(ii) Extant guidelines allow extension of GML to jewellery exporters and domestic \njewellery manufacturers. It is proposed to allow GML to domestic non-\nmanufacturers as well, for outsourcing their manufacturing of jewellery. \n \n \n \n4 \n5. Large Exposures Framework (Amendment Circular), 2025; and \nGuidelines on Management of Intragroup Transactions and Exposures \n(Amendment Circular), 2025 \n     Circulars on Large Exposures Framework (LEF) dated June 3, 2019, Large \nExposures Framework \u2013 Credit Risk Mitigation (CRM) for offsetting \u2013 non-\ncentrally cleared derivative transactions of foreign bank branches in India with \ntheir Head Office (LEF-CRM) dated September 9, 2021, and Guidelines on \nManagement of Intra-Group Transactions and Exposures (ITE) dated February \n11, 2014 prescribe prudential norms on a bank\u2019s exposures to its counterparties \nas also those to its group entities.  \n     The two Amendment Circulars amend the extant norms to clarify certain \naspects on prudential treatment of exposures of foreign bank operating as \nbranches in India and aligning some of the prudential norms under LEF and ITE. \nThe key changes include the following: \n(i) \nExposure of Indian branches of foreign banks to their HO, and \nbranches/subsidiaries of the HO, shall be reckoned only for LEF, and \nnot ITE. Such exposures, where cleared through a central \ncounterparty, shall be considered on a gross basis.  \n(ii) \nFunds received from the HO, and kept by the Indian branch of a foreign \nbank under a special arrangement with RBI as cash/unencumbered \napproved securities, are treated as CRM for offsetting non-centrally \ncleared derivative transactions of such branches with their HO. It is \nproposed to extend the CRM benefit to any exposure of a foreign bank \nbranch to its HO.  \n(iii) \nComputation of exposure under ITE is proposed to be made consistent \nwith those under LEF i.e., the benefit of credit conversion factor for \ndeciding credit equivalence of off-balance sheet exposures, and credit \nrisk mitigation technique for offsetting exposures to a counterparty, \nshall henceforth be permitted for ITE exposures.  \n(iv) \nThe ITE threshold, which is currently linked to Paid-up Capital and \nReserves, is proposed to be linked to Tier-1 capital of banks.  \n \n \n \n5 \n6. Draft Reserve Bank of India (Credit Information Reporting) (1st \nAmendment) Directions, 2025 \n     The Master Direction \u2013 Reserve Bank of India (Credit Information Reporting) \nDirections, 2025 mandates submission of credit information by Credit Institutions \n(CIs) to Credit Information Companies (CICs) at fortnightly or shorter intervals. \nGiven the increasing reliance of CIs on credit information reports in credit \nunderwriting processes, it is imperative that the credit information reports (CIR) \nprovided by CICs reflect a more recent information. Accordingly, the provisions \nof the Master Direction \u2013 Reserve Bank of India (Credit Information Reporting) \nDirections, 2025 pertaining to frequency of reporting of credit information by CIs \nto CICs have been reviewed. \n     It is proposed to transition to weekly credit information submission by CIs to \nCICs. The Draft amendments also mandate measures to facilitate faster data \nsubmission and error rectification by the CIs. Further, to facilitate aggregation of \ncredit information by CICs, it is proposed to capture Central Know Your Customer \n(CKYC) number in a separate field in the reporting format of consumer segment. \n \n \n \n     The comments on the draft Directions/Circulars are invited from the banks, \nmarket participants, and other interested parties till October 20, 2025. The \ncomments/ feedback may be submitted through the link under the \u2018Connect 2 \nRegulate\u2019 Section available on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website. Comments may \nalternatively be forwarded to The Chief General Manager-in-Charge, Department \nof Regulation, Central Office Reserve Bank of India, 12th/ 13th Floor Shahid \nBhagat Singh Marg, Fort Mumbai \u2013 400 001 or by email.  \n \n \n                                                                                          (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1197                                     Chief General Manager \n \n \n \n",

Based on supervisory findings of contravention of statutory \nprovisions / non-compliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that \nregard, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty \nshould not be imposed on it for its failure to comply with the said provisions and \ndirections. After considering the bank's reply to the notice, additional submissions \nmade by it and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter \nalia, that the following charges against the bank were sustained, warranting \nimposition of monetary penalty: \n \nThe bank had: \ni) failed to transfer eligible unclaimed amounts to the Depositor Education and \nAwareness Fund within the prescribed time; \nii) failed to submit credit information of its customers to all the four CICs; and \niii) failed to undertake requisite Customer Due Diligence (CDD) procedure while \nestablishing account-based relationship in certain accounts. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers.

Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1190                                             Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

This penalty has been imposed in exercise \nof powers conferred on RBI under clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 58G read \nwith clause (aa) of sub-section (5) of Section 58B of the Reserve Bank of India Act, \n1934. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the company was conducted by RBI with reference to \nits financial position as on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice \nwas issued to the company advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be \nimposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions.  \n \n     After considering the company\u2019s reply to the notice, additional submissions made \nby it and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, \nthat the following charge against the company was sustained, warranting imposition \nof monetary penalty:  \n \n     The company failed to establish a system of auto escalation of complaints that \nwere partly or wholly rejected by the company\u2019s internal grievance redress \nmechanism to its Internal Ombudsman. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \ncompany with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the company. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1181                                            Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

(Table 1) \n\u2022 \nThe consolidated balance sheets (in terms of USD) of overseas branches and \nsubsidiaries of Indian banks registered a growth of 9.1 per cent and 4.2 per cent, \nrespectively, in 2024-25. In comparison, the consolidated balance sheets of foreign \nbanks operating in India expanded at a much higher rate, recording growth of 17.5 per \ncent, in USD terms. (Table 2) \n\u2022 \nDuring the year, both lending and deposit mobilisation by the overseas branches of \nIndian banks strengthened, recording growth of 5.6 per cent and 9.4 per cent, \nrespectively, in USD terms. \n\u2022 \nThe branches of foreign banks in India registered robust credit growth of 8.4 per cent \nduring the year 2024-25, a marginal increase from 8.1 per cent in the previous year. \nHowever, deposit growth decelerated sharply, falling to 6.8 per cent from 16.4 per \ncent a year earlier. (Table 2) \n\u2022 \nThe shift in the monetary policy cycle in most major economies, coupled with the high \nbase of the previous year, led to a substantial moderation in the growth of interest \nincome and expenses across all the three cohorts during the year. The fall in growth \nrate was most pronounced for the overseas branches of Indian banks, where interest \nincome and interest expenses grew by only 8.0 per cent and 9.0 per cent, \nrespectively, compared to 72.0 per cent 87.5 per cent recorded in the previous year. \n(Table 3) \n \n1 The 2023\u201324 round of survey had covered 14 Indian banks with overseas branches/subsidiaries and 45 foreign banks with \nbranches/subsidiaries in India. The results for 2023\u201324 survey were disseminated through press release on October 25, 2024. \n \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n\u2022 \nThe total income to assets ratio of overseas branches of Indian banks declined to 5.9 \nper cent in 2024-25 from 6.2 per cent in 2023-24.

The framework, however, does not call for \ndiscontinuation of SMS based OTP as an authentication factor.  \nb. Enabling issuers to adopt additional risk-based checks beyond the minimum \ntwo-factor authentication based on the fraud risk perception of the underlying \ntransaction.  \nc. Facilitating interoperability and open access to technology  \nd. Delineating the responsibility of Issuers. \ne. Mandating card issuers to validate AFA in non-recurring cross-border CNP \ntransactions whenever such a request is raised by the overseas merchant or \nacquirer. \n \n     These directions shall be complied with by April 01, 2026, unless indicated \notherwise for any particular direction.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1165                                             Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

    "file_extracted_text": "1 \n \nSeptember 24, 2025 \n \nRBI Bulletin \u2013 September 2025 \n \n     Today, the Reserve Bank released the September 2025 issue of its monthly \nBulletin. The Bulletin includes one speech, seven articles and current statistics.  \n \n     The seven articles are: I. State of the Economy; II. Flow of Financial Resources to \nCommercial Sector in India during 2024-25; III. The Untold Story of FinTech \nCustomers\u2019 Experience; IV. Review of Performance of the NBFC Sector; V. Impact of \nUPI on Cash Demand \u2013 Evidence from National and Subnational Levels; VI. Is \nConsumption Inequality Declining? \u2013 What the 2022-23 NSSO Survey Tells Us; and \nVII. Infrastructure - An Engine of India\u2019s Growth Express. \n \nI. \nState of the Economy \n \n     Global uncertainty remained elevated in the wake of imposition of US trade tariffs \non major trading partners and renewed concerns over fiscal health of advanced \neconomies. The Indian economy exhibited marked resilience as evident from the five-\nquarter high growth during Q1:2025-26, propelled by domestic drivers. The landmark \nGST reforms should progressively result in a sustained positive impact through \nsignificant gains in ease of doing business, lower retail prices and strengthening of \nconsumption growth drivers. CPI headline inflation edged up but remained well below \nthe target rate for the seventh consecutive month. System liquidity remained in surplus \nfacilitating the pass through of policy rate cuts. Indian equity markets witnessed \nbidirectional movements during August-September. India\u2019s current account deficit \nmoderated in Q1 over last year, supported by robust services exports and strong \nremittances receipts. \n \nII. \nFlow of Financial Resources to Commercial Sector in India during 2024-\n25 \n \nBy Amit Pawar, Abhinandan Borad, Pawan Kumar, John V. Guria and Vishal Raina \n \n     The article analyses the total flow of financial resources to the commercial sector \nin India during 2024-25 vis-\u00e0-vis 2023-24, covering both banks and non-bank \n(including domestic and foreign) sources of funding.  \n \n \n \n \n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n  \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u01d0\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n  \u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u036a\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0223\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0223\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u0367\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 During 2024-25, the flow of non-food bank credit moderated, however, an increase \nin funding from non-bank sources more than offset the moderation in the flow of \nbank credit, resulting in an increase in total flow of financial resources to the \ncommercial sector in India.  \n\u2022 The moderation in flow of non-food bank credit during 2024-25 was mainly due to \na slowdown in credit to segments whose risk weights were increased by the \nReserve Bank in November 2023 to restrict unsecured lending aimed at \nstrengthening financial stability. \n\u2022 The increase in funding from non-bank sources during 2024-25 was largely driven \nby equity issuances, credit by Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), and \nshort-term external credit. Equity issuances increased amidst buoyancy in the \ndomestic secondary market, while short-term external credit rose reflecting a \nrebound in merchandise imports. \n\u2022 Overall, the outstanding credit from banks and non-bank sources as per cent to \nGDP increased at end-March 2025 from its level a year ago.  \n \nIII. \nThe Untold Story of FinTech Customers\u2019 Experience \n \nBy Ashish Khobragade, Sakshi Awasthy, Mantisha and Rakhe Balachandran \n \n     Based on an analysis of around 5.69 million FinTech app reviews, this study reveals \nkey customer concerns and review sentiments, along with their determinants in India\u2019s \nFinTech ecosystem. \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 User experience is generally positive, with emotions like trust and joy \ndominating across FinTech business segments.  \n\u2022 Major customer concerns across segments relate to customer support and \nservice, app functionality and technical issues, and loan related issues in \napplication and approval, credit limit and credit score. \n\u2022 Market share, major app updates and data privacy policies of the apps \nsignificantly drive the positive user experience in India\u2019s FinTech ecosystem.  \n  \nIV. \nReview of Performance of the NBFC Sector \n \nBy Abhyuday Harsh, Pallavi Pant, Nandini Jayakumar, Rajnish Kumar Chandra and, \nBrijesh P \n \n     This article contextualises India\u2019s non-banking sector in the global context and \nevaluates the performance of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) up to Q3 of \n2024-25, utilising supervisory returns. Given the rising prominence of NBFCs in credit \nintermediation in the Indian economy, the article also makes an empirical assessment \nof monetary policy transmission to NBFCs\u2019 borrowing and lending rates. \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 \nThe increasing role of NBFCs in credit provision, especially to the industrial and \nretail sectors, is clearly reflected in their rising credit-to-GDP ratio. \n\u2022 \nAt end-December 2024, the financial health of the sector remained strong, as \nreflected in key indicators such as return on assets, capital to risk-weighted \nassets, and non-performing assets. \n\u2022 \nThe empirical analysis shows that there is transmission of monetary policy \nimpulses to NBFCs\u2019 borrowing and lending rates, albeit, incomplete. \n \nV. \nImpact of UPI on Cash Demand \u2013 Evidence from National and Subnational \nLevels \n \nBy Sakshi Awasthy and Subrat Kumar Seet \n \n     While the broader shift to digital payments is well-established, regional adoption of \nthe Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and its impact on cash demand remain \nunderexplored. This article examines the impact of UPI on cash demand at both \nnational and sub-national levels.  \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 India\u2019s payment landscape is undergoing a structural shift, evident from currency \ngrowth moderating from pandemic levels and sustained UPI expansion with \nnarrowing ticket sizes. At the state level, however, preference between cash and \nUPI varies across regions.    \n\u2022 Empirical results show that higher UPI adoption is associated with lower cash \ndemand at both national and sub-national levels, with state-level patterns \nsuggesting non-linearity.    \n\u2022 Among other state-wise factors, income and ATM density are positively associated \nwith cash demand, whereas workforce formalisation and educational attainment \nare linked to lower cash reliance. \n \nVI. \nIs Consumption Inequality Declining? \u2013 What the 2022-23 NSSO Survey \nTells Us \n \nBy Kaustubh, Satadru Das, Pawan Gopalakrishnan, and Debojyoti Mazumder \n \n     This article estimates trends in household consumption inequality across various \ndimensions based on the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) of \n2022\u201323 and its comparison with HCES 2011-12.  \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 Household consumption inequality has declined across expenditure classes and \nbetween the rural and urban areas. \n\u2022 There is strong evidence of convergence in real per capita consumption \nexpenditure across states, with poorer states, on-average, showing faster growth \nthan their richer counterparts in both urban and rural areas.  \n4 \n \n\u2022 An updated Rangarajan poverty line based on 2022-23 price levels reveals a \nsignificant reduction in poverty incidence across states. \n \nVII. \nInfrastructure - An Engine of India\u2019s Growth Express \n \nBy Ashutosh Raravikar and Abhishek Ranjan \n \n     In the context of India\u2019s policy thrust on development of infrastructure, this study \nanalyses the relationship between infrastructure and economic growth and discusses \noptions and strategies for financing infrastructure.  \n \nHighlights: \n \n\uf0a7 Over the last decade, India focused on development of physical, social and \ndigital infrastructure with an integrated and inclusive approach. \n\uf0a7 By creating indices of infrastructure using different methods, the study finds that \ninfrastructure has positively and significantly impacted GDP growth in India.  \n\uf0a7 Going forward, the broad-based expansion in infrastructure based on \nmacroeconomic assessment of infrastructure gaps and developing suitable \nfinancing avenues and strategies would take the growth story further ahead. \n \n     The views expressed in the Bulletin articles are of the authors and do not represent \nthe views of the Reserve Bank of India. \n \n \n                                                                                                   (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1161                                             Chief General Manager \n \n",

The Code is a set of global principles of good \npractice in the FX market developed to provide a common set of guidelines to \npromote the integrity and effective functioning of the wholesale foreign exchange \nmarket. It was developed by a partnership between central banks and market \nparticipants from around the globe and was first published in 2017.  \n \n     The Global Foreign Exchange Committee (GFXC) is entrusted with the promotion, \nmaintenance and updating the Code. Accordingly, the GFXC has reviewed and \nupdated the Code twice, first in July 2021 and more recently in December 2024. The \nCode and other related information are available at: https://www.globalfxc.org/. \n \n     The Reserve Bank continues to support the principles of good practices within the \nCode.  \n \nRenewed Statement of Commitment to the FX Global Code  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1156                                             Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
