    "file_extracted_text": " \n September 04, 2025 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on Dahanu Road Janata Co-operative Bank Ltd., \nDahanu Road, Maharashtra \n    \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated September 01, 2025, \nimposed a monetary penalty of \u20b91 lakh (Rupees One Lakh only) on Dahanu Road \nJanata Co-operative Bank Ltd., Dahanu Road, Maharashtra (the bank), for non-\ncompliance with specific directions issued by RBI under Supervisory Action \nFramework (SAF). This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred \non RBI under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read with Sections 46(4)(i) and 56 \nof the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by RBI with reference to its \nfinancial position as on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice \nwas issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be \nimposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the \nbank\u2019s reply to the notice and additional submissions made by it, RBI found, inter \nalia, that the following charge against the bank was sustained, warranting imposition \nof monetary penalty: \n \n     The bank had not reduced both single and group borrower exposure limits for \ncertain fresh loans and advances, by 25% of the applicable regulatory limit in non-\nadherence to directions under SAF. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered by the bank \nwith its customers. Further, imposition of monetary penalty is without prejudice to any \nother action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1038                                             Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI \nunder the provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) and Section 46(4)(i) read with Section 56 of \nthe BR Act. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by the National Bank for \nAgriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), with reference to its financial position \nas on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-compliance with \nstatutory provisions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued \nto the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it \nfor its failure to comply with the said provisions. After considering the bank's reply to \nthe notice, additional submissions and oral submissions made during the personal \nhearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charge against the bank was \nsustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: \n \n     The bank had failed to transfer eligible unclaimed amounts to the Depositor \nEducation and Awareness Fund within the prescribed time. \n  \n     This action is based on deficiencies in statutory compliance and is not intended to \npronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank \nwith its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without prejudice to \nany other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n             (Puneet Pancholy)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1019                                           Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

    "file_extracted_text": " August 29, 2025 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on Bandhan Bank Limited \n \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated August 26, 2025, \nimposed a monetary penalty of \u20b944.70 lakh (Rupees Forty-Four Lakh and Seventy \nThousand only) on Bandhan Bank Limited (the bank) for contravention of section \n10(1)(b)(ii) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (BR Act), and non-compliance with \ncertain directions issued by RBI on \u2018Automation of Income Recognition, Asset \nClassification and Provisioning processes in banks\u2019. This penalty has been imposed \nin exercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of section 47 A (1) (c) \nread with section 46 (4) of the BR Act. \n \n     The Statutory Inspection for Supervisory Evaluation of the bank was conducted by \nRBI with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2024. Based on \nsupervisory \nfindings \nof \nnon-compliance \nwith \nRBI \ndirections \nand \nrelated \ncorrespondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show \ncause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure to comply with the \nsaid RBI directions.  \n \n     After considering the bank\u2019s reply to the notice and oral submissions made during \nthe personal hearing, RBI found that the following charges against the bank were \nsustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: \n \ni) The bank paid remuneration in the form of commission to certain employees; and \nii) The bank had carried out manual intervention through back-end in respect of data \nof certain accounts and had not captured the audit trails / logs of access with \nspecific user details in the system.  \n \n     The action is based on deficiencies in statutory and regulatory compliance and is \nnot intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered \ninto by the bank with its customers. Further, imposition of monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1006                                             Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

State of the Economy; II. Private Corporate Investment: \nGrowth in 2024-25 and Outlook for 2025-26; III. Equity Mutual Funds: Transforming \nIndia\u2019s Savings Landscape; IV. EV Policies and Two-Wheeler EV Adoption: Evidence \nfrom Indian States; and V. Horticultural Diversification: A Pathway to Agricultural \nResilience. \nI. \nState of the Economy \n     Continuing uncertainty on US trade policies shaped the global macroeconomic \nenvironment during July and August. Domestic economic activity remained mixed \nacross sectors in July. Timely progress of monsoon has boosted kharif sowing. While \nindustrial activity remained subdued, manufacturing sector expanded along with \nservices sector sustaining the growth momentum. Headline inflation fell for the ninth \nconsecutive month in July. Financial conditions remained congenial and supportive of \ndomestic economic activity. India\u2019s sovereign rating upgrade by S&P bodes well for \ncapital inflows and sovereign yields, going forward. \nII. \nPrivate Corporate Investment: Growth in 2024-25 and Outlook for 2025-\n26 \nBy Snigdha Yogindran, Sukti Khandekar, Rajesh B Kavediya and Aloke Ghosh \n     Private corporate sector plays a vital role in driving the overall investment trend in \nthe economy. Drawing on data related to the phasing of capital expenditure (capex) \nplans announced by private corporates, this article assesses their investment \nintentions and provides insights into the near-term outlook. \nHighlights: \n\u2022 The total cost of projects as well as the number of projects sanctioned by banks \nand financial institutions (FIs) decreased during 2024-25 as compared to previous \nyear, indicating tepid investment optimism of private corporates. \n\u2022 Infrastructure sector continued to attract major share of envisaged capital \ninvestment, led by \u2018Power\u2019 industry. \n\u2022 The phasing profile of the pipeline projects based on all channels of financing taken \ntogether, suggests that the envisaged capex is estimated at \u20b92,67,432 crore in \n2025-26 as against \u20b92,20,132 crore in 2024-25. \n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u01d0\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u036a\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0223\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0223\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u0367\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n \nIII. \nEquity Mutual Funds: Transforming India\u2019s Savings Landscape \nBy Mayank Gupta, Satyam Kumar, Abhinandan Borad, Subrat Kumar Seet and \nPratibha Kedia \n     This article examines the evolving landscape of household savings in India, \nhighlighting the increasing preference among retail investors for equity mutual funds \n(MFs) as a key investment avenue. It presents a comprehensive analysis of the \nstructural shift in investor behaviour and the key factors influencing flows into equity \nmutual funds. Despite robust growth, India\u2019s mutual fund industry remains relatively \nsmall compared to global benchmarks, pointing to significant scope for further \nexpansion. \nHighlights: \n\u2022 Over the past decade, household financial saving preferences have undergone a \nnotable shift, with an increasing inclination toward equity-oriented instruments, \nparticularly equity mutual funds. \n\u2022 The study identifies increasing financial inclusion (proxied by demat accounts), \nrelative market returns, and business confidence as critical drivers of equity mutual \nfund flows in India. \n\u2022 Empirical analysis suggests that real GDP growth contains predictive information \nabout equity mutual fund flows. \n\u2022 As retail participation deepens, especially from smaller towns and among women \ninvestors, there is a need for continued emphasis on investor awareness, financial \nliteracy, and prudent regulatory oversight to ensure sustained and inclusive growth \nof the mutual fund sector.  \nIV. \nEV Policies and Two-Wheeler EV Adoption: Evidence from Indian States \nBy Atal Singh, Satyam Kumar, Abhyuday Harsh and Tista Tiwari \n     With nearly three-fourths of vehicle registrations in India comprising two-wheelers \n(2W) in 2024-25, it is imperative that any initiative aimed at promoting electric vehicles \n(EVs) must focus on the adoption of 2W-EVs to meet the country's decarbonisation \ngoals. In this context, this paper empirically investigates the impact of state-level EV \npromotion policies on the adoption of 2W-EVs. \nHighlights: \n\u2022 Supportive policies at state level (such as financial incentives, tax exemptions, and \ninvestments in charging infrastructure) drive the adoption of 2W-EVs. \n\u2022 Regional disparity exists in adoption rates, with southern and western states \nexhibiting higher adoption rates, partly due to better charging infrastructure and the \nearly development of EV policies. \n\u2022 Strong charging infrastructure, even with moderate policy support, can enhance \nthe adoption of 2W-EVs. \n \n \n3 \n \n \n  \nV. \nHorticultural Diversification: A Pathway to Agricultural Resilience \nBy Shivam \n     The article investigates the source of agricultural growth over the past three \ndecades (1992-93 to 2022-23) and quantifies the contribution of different crops to the \noverall growth of agriculture. The study examines the implications of diversification-\nled growth for small farmers and discusses the challenges thereof.  \nHighlights: \n\u2022 Agricultural growth over the past three decades has primarily been driven by yield \nimprovements, diversification into horticulture and increased cropping intensity.  \n\u2022 Fruits and vegetables, the key components of horticulture, show consistently high \ngrowth rates and significantly contribute to Gross Value Output.  \n\u2022 Small and marginal farmers have benefited from these trends and are increasingly \nallocating land to horticulture.  \n\u2022 Challenges include yield unpredictability, inadequate post-harvest storage, and \nprice volatility. Government initiatives such as the National Horticulture Mission, \nHorticulture Cluster Development Board, Agriculture Infrastructure Fund, Pradhan \nMantri Formalisation of Micro Food Processing Enterprises, and Operation Greens \nare addressing these challenges. \n     The views expressed in the Bulletin articles are of the authors and do not \nrepresent the views of the Reserve Bank of India. \n \n \n               (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/992                                               Chief General Manager \n",

    "file_extracted_text": " \n August 28, 2025 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on The Purasawalkam Co-operative Bank \nLimited, Tamil Nadu \n \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated August 19, 2025, \nimposed a monetary penalty of \u20b91.00 lakh (Rupees One Lakh only) on                      \nThe Purasawalkam Co-operative Bank Limited, Tamil Nadu (the bank) for non-\ncompliance with certain directions issued by RBI on \u2018Prudential Norms on Capital \nAdequacy - Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs)\u2019 and specific directions \nissued by RBI under \u2018Supervisory Action Framework (SAF)\u2019. This penalty has been \nimposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section \n47A(1)(c) read with Sections 46(4)(i) and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by RBI with reference to its \nfinancial position as on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice \nwas issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be \nimposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the \nbank\u2019s reply to the notice and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, \nRBI found, inter alia, that the following charges against the bank were sustained, \nwarranting imposition of monetary penalty: \n \nThe bank had:  \ni) allowed the refund of share capital to its members, despite its CRAR being \nless than the regulatory minimum; \nii) not reduced single borrower exposure limit, for fresh loans and advances, by \n50% of the applicable regulatory limit in non-adherence to directions  \nunder SAF. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n             (Puneet Pancholy)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/987                                             Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
