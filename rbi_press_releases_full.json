The Bulletin includes one speech, seven articles and current statistics.  \n \n     The seven articles are: I. State of the Economy; II. Flow of Financial Resources to \nCommercial Sector in India during 2024-25; III. The Untold Story of FinTech \nCustomers\u2019 Experience; IV. Review of Performance of the NBFC Sector; V. Impact of \nUPI on Cash Demand \u2013 Evidence from National and Subnational Levels; VI. Is \nConsumption Inequality Declining? \u2013 What the 2022-23 NSSO Survey Tells Us; and \nVII. Infrastructure - An Engine of India\u2019s Growth Express. \n \nI. \nState of the Economy \n \n     Global uncertainty remained elevated in the wake of imposition of US trade tariffs \non major trading partners and renewed concerns over fiscal health of advanced \neconomies. The Indian economy exhibited marked resilience as evident from the five-\nquarter high growth during Q1:2025-26, propelled by domestic drivers. The landmark \nGST reforms should progressively result in a sustained positive impact through \nsignificant gains in ease of doing business, lower retail prices and strengthening of \nconsumption growth drivers. CPI headline inflation edged up but remained well below \nthe target rate for the seventh consecutive month. System liquidity remained in surplus \nfacilitating the pass through of policy rate cuts.

Equity issuances increased amidst buoyancy in the \ndomestic secondary market, while short-term external credit rose reflecting a \nrebound in merchandise imports. \n\u2022 Overall, the outstanding credit from banks and non-bank sources as per cent to \nGDP increased at end-March 2025 from its level a year ago.  \n \nIII. \nThe Untold Story of FinTech Customers\u2019 Experience \n \nBy Ashish Khobragade, Sakshi Awasthy, Mantisha and Rakhe Balachandran \n \n     Based on an analysis of around 5.69 million FinTech app reviews, this study reveals \nkey customer concerns and review sentiments, along with their determinants in India\u2019s \nFinTech ecosystem. \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 User experience is generally positive, with emotions like trust and joy \ndominating across FinTech business segments.  \n\u2022 Major customer concerns across segments relate to customer support and \nservice, app functionality and technical issues, and loan related issues in \napplication and approval, credit limit and credit score. \n\u2022 Market share, major app updates and data privacy policies of the apps \nsignificantly drive the positive user experience in India\u2019s FinTech ecosystem.  \n  \nIV. \nReview of Performance of the NBFC Sector \n \nBy Abhyuday Harsh, Pallavi Pant, Nandini Jayakumar, Rajnish Kumar Chandra and, \nBrijesh P \n \n     This article contextualises India\u2019s non-banking sector in the global context and \nevaluates the performance of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) up to Q3 of \n2024-25, utilising supervisory returns. Given the rising prominence of NBFCs in credit \nintermediation in the Indian economy, the article also makes an empirical assessment \nof monetary policy transmission to NBFCs\u2019 borrowing and lending rates. \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 \nThe increasing role of NBFCs in credit provision, especially to the industrial and \nretail sectors, is clearly reflected in their rising credit-to-GDP ratio. \n\u2022 \nAt end-December 2024, the financial health of the sector remained strong, as \nreflected in key indicators such as return on assets, capital to risk-weighted \nassets, and non-performing assets. \n\u2022 \nThe empirical analysis shows that there is transmission of monetary policy \nimpulses to NBFCs\u2019 borrowing and lending rates, albeit, incomplete. \n \nV. \nImpact of UPI on Cash Demand \u2013 Evidence from National and Subnational \nLevels \n \nBy Sakshi Awasthy and Subrat Kumar Seet \n \n     While the broader shift to digital payments is well-established, regional adoption of \nthe Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and its impact on cash demand remain \nunderexplored. This article examines the impact of UPI on cash demand at both \nnational and sub-national levels.  \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 India\u2019s payment landscape is undergoing a structural shift, evident from currency \ngrowth moderating from pandemic levels and sustained UPI expansion with \nnarrowing ticket sizes. At the state level, however, preference between cash and \nUPI varies across regions.    \n\u2022 Empirical results show that higher UPI adoption is associated with lower cash \ndemand at both national and sub-national levels, with state-level patterns \nsuggesting non-linearity.    \n\u2022 Among other state-wise factors, income and ATM density are positively associated \nwith cash demand, whereas workforce formalisation and educational attainment \nare linked to lower cash reliance. \n \nVI. \nIs Consumption Inequality Declining? \u2013 What the 2022-23 NSSO Survey \nTells Us \n \nBy Kaustubh, Satadru Das, Pawan Gopalakrishnan, and Debojyoti Mazumder \n \n     This article estimates trends in household consumption inequality across various \ndimensions based on the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) of \n2022\u201323 and its comparison with HCES 2011-12.  \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 Household consumption inequality has declined across expenditure classes and \nbetween the rural and urban areas. \n\u2022 There is strong evidence of convergence in real per capita consumption \nexpenditure across states, with poorer states, on-average, showing faster growth \nthan their richer counterparts in both urban and rural areas.  \n4 \n \n\u2022 An updated Rangarajan poverty line based on 2022-23 price levels reveals a \nsignificant reduction in poverty incidence across states. \n \nVII. \nInfrastructure - An Engine of India\u2019s Growth Express \n \nBy Ashutosh Raravikar and Abhishek Ranjan \n \n     In the context of India\u2019s policy thrust on development of infrastructure, this study \nanalyses the relationship between infrastructure and economic growth and discusses \noptions and strategies for financing infrastructure.  \n \nHighlights: \n \n\uf0a7 Over the last decade, India focused on development of physical, social and \ndigital infrastructure with an integrated and inclusive approach. \n\uf0a7 By creating indices of infrastructure using different methods, the study finds that \ninfrastructure has positively and significantly impacted GDP growth in India.  \n\uf0a7 Going forward, the broad-based expansion in infrastructure based on \nmacroeconomic assessment of infrastructure gaps and developing suitable \nfinancing avenues and strategies would take the growth story further ahead. \n \n     The views expressed in the Bulletin articles are of the authors and do not represent \nthe views of the Reserve Bank of India. \n \n \n                                                                                                   (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1161                                             Chief General Manager \n \n",

The Code is a set of global principles of good \npractice in the FX market developed to provide a common set of guidelines to \npromote the integrity and effective functioning of the wholesale foreign exchange \nmarket. It was developed by a partnership between central banks and market \nparticipants from around the globe and was first published in 2017.  \n \n     The Global Foreign Exchange Committee (GFXC) is entrusted with the promotion, \nmaintenance and updating the Code. Accordingly, the GFXC has reviewed and \nupdated the Code twice, first in July 2021 and more recently in December 2024. The \nCode and other related information are available at: https://www.globalfxc.org/. \n \n     The Reserve Bank continues to support the principles of good practices within the \nCode.  \n \nRenewed Statement of Commitment to the FX Global Code  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1156                                             Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
