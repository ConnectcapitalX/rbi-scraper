    "file_extracted_text": " \n January 05, 2026 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on Jila Sahakari Bank Limited, Mau,  \nUttar Pradesh \n \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated December 31, 2025, \nimposed a monetary penalty of \u20b92 lakh (Rupees Two Lakh only) on Jila Sahakari \nBank Limited, Mau, Uttar Pradesh (the bank) for non-compliance with certain \ndirections issued by RBI on \u2018Know Your Customer (KYC)\u2019. This penalty has been \nimposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section \n47A(1)(c) read with Sections 46(4)(i) and 56 of BR Act. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by National Bank for \nAgriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) with reference to its financial position \nas on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-compliance with RBI \ndirections and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the bank \nadvising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure \nto comply with the said directions. After considering the bank\u2019s reply to the notice and \noral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the \nfollowing charges against the bank were sustained, warranting imposition of monetary \npenalty: \n \nThe bank had failed to:  \ni. \nput in place a system of periodic review of risk categorisation of accounts, \nwith such periodicity being at least once in six months; and \nii. \ncarry out periodic updation of KYC of its customers. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n                    (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1846                                           Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

It was a \ncombined impact of decrease in foreign-owned assets in India (US$ 29.8 billion) \nand increase in Indian residents\u2019 overseas financial assets (US$ 8.6 billion) \nduring the quarter (Table 1). \n \n\u2022 Accordingly, the ratio of India\u2019s international assets to international liabilities \nimproved to 81.3 per cent as at end-September 2025 from 79.1 per cent a \nquarter ago. The ratio has consistently improved from 71.4 per cent two years \nago and 76.1 per cent a year ago (Chart 1 & Table 1). \n \n\u2022 The decline of all major components of foreign-owned assets in India viz., inward \nportfolio investment (US$ 13.9 billion), direct investment (US$ 8.9 billion) and \nother investment (US$ 7.0 billion) contributed to the overall decline of foreign-\nowned assets in India. \n \n\u2022 Indian residents\u2019 overseas financial assets increased during the quarter, mainly \non the back of higher outward direct investments. \n \n\u2022 Reserve assets stood at US$ 700.1 billion as at end-September 2025 and \naccounted for 58.8 per cent of overseas financial assets of Indian residents \n(Table 2).  \n \n\u2022 The share of debt liabilities in total external liabilities increased marginally to 55.0 \nper cent as at end-September 2025 from 54.3 per cent a quarter ago (Table 3). \n \n \n \n \n \n                    (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1810                                             Chief General Manager \n \n[1] India\u2019s quarterly IIP is disseminated with a lag of one quarter and the previous quarterly IIP for end-June 2025 was \nreleased in the RBI website on September 30, 2025. \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \nTable 1:  Overall International Investment Position of India \n(US$ billion) \nPeriod \nPosition as at end of \nSep-24   \n(PR) \nDec-24 \n(PR) \nMar-25 \n(PR) \nJun-25   \n(PR) \nSep-25 \n(P) \nNet IIP (A-B) \n-353.4 \n-364.0 \n-329.1 \n-312.7 \n-274.3 \nA.

However, downside risks persist due to still \nelevated uncertainty, high public debt, and the risk of a disorderly market correction. \n\u2022 Global financial markets appear strong on the surface but show growing underlying \nvulnerabilities. Sharp rise in equities and other risk assets, the expanding role of \nnon-bank financial intermediaries and their deepening interconnectedness with \nbanks, and the growth of stablecoins all heighten global financial system fragilities. \n\u2022 Despite an uncertain and challenging global economic backdrop, the Indian \neconomy continues to grow strongly, underpinned by robust domestic demand, \nbenign inflation, and prudent macroeconomic policies. \n\u2022 The domestic financial system remains robust and resilient, bolstered by strong \nbalance sheets, easy financial conditions, and low financial market volatility. \nNonetheless, there are near-term risks from external uncertainties - geopolitical and \ntrade related.  \n\u2022 The health of the scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) remains sound with strong \ncapital and liquidity buffers, improved asset quality and robust profitability. \n\u2022 Macro stress test results affirm the resilience of SCBs to withstand losses under \nhypothetical adverse scenarios and maintain capital buffers well above the \nregulatory minimum. Stress tests also confirm the resilience of mutual funds and \nclearing corporations. \n\u2022 Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) remain robust supported by strong capital \nbuffers, solid earnings, and improving asset quality. \n\u2022 The insurance sector continues to display balance sheet resilience and the \nconsolidated solvency ratio remained above the minimum threshold limit. \n \n \n                                (Brij Raj)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1807                                                       Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
