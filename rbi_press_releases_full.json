State of the Economy; and II. Financial Stocks and Flow of \nFunds of the Indian Economy 2023-24.  \n \nI. \nState of the Economy \n \nGlobal growth remained resilient in 2025 despite heightened uncertainties. Though \nelevated, global uncertainty witnessed further moderation in December. The first \nadvance estimates of real GDP growth for 2025-26 reflected the resilience of the \nIndian economy, driven by domestic factors amidst a challenging external \nenvironment. High-frequency indicators for December suggest continued buoyancy in \ngrowth impulses with demand conditions remaining upbeat. Headline CPI inflation \nedged up in December but remained below the lower tolerance level. The flow of \nfinancial resources to the commercial sector has increased over the past year, with \nboth non-bank and bank sources contributing to the credit pick-up. \n \nII. \nFinancial Stocks and Flow of Funds of the Indian Economy 2023-24 \n \nBy Suraj S, Ishu Thakur and Mousumi Priyadarshini \n \nThis article presents underlying trends in the financial stocks and flows (FSF) across \nthe institutional sectors of the Indian economy during 2023-24 on a from-whom-to-\nwhom (FWTW) basis. The analysis of financial flows provides insights into inter-\nlinkages across sectors by tracking the sources and uses of funds reflecting the \nmacroeconomic trends. The sectoral/sub-sectoral statements for the period 2011-12 \nto 2023-24 are also being released with the article. \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 The financial assets of the domestic sectors registered a growth of 13.9 per cent \nin 2023-24, up from 9.9 per cent in 2022-23, while financial liabilities increased by \n12.7 per cent higher than that of 10.4 per cent in the previous year. \n \n\u2022 The financial resource balance of the domestic economy indicates reduction of \ndeficit to 0.9 per cent of GDP in 2023-24 from 2.3 per cent of GDP in 2022-23. \n \n\u2022 Households and financial corporations remained as surplus sectors, financing the \ngeneral government's and non-financial corporations' deficits. \n \n\u2022 Net financial wealth of domestic sectors rose to 28.6 per cent of GDP in 2023-24 \nfrom 24.8 per cent in 2022-23, signalling a broad-based strengthening of financial \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \nbalance sheets of households, general government, and non-financial \ncorporations.  \n \n\u2022 Despite global uncertainties, financial assets and liabilities of the rest of the world \n(RoW) increased in 2023-24, indicating the increased openness on the external \nfront.  \n \n\u2022 Currency and deposits, loans and advances, and debt securities accounted for \nnearly two-thirds of the total financial assets and liabilities at end-March 2024. \n \n     The views expressed in the Bulletin articles are of the authors and do not \nrepresent the views of the Reserve Bank of India. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1962                                       Chief General Manager \n",

This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred \non RBI under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read with Sections 46(4)(i) and 56 of \nthe Banking Regulation Act, 1949. \n \n2. The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by the RBI with reference to its \nfinancial position as on March 31, 2025. Based on supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice \nwas issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be \nimposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the \nbank's reply to the notice, additional submissions made by it and oral submissions \nmade during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charge \nagainst the bank was sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: \n \n3. The bank had sanctioned loans in excess of the prescribed regulatory limit to certain \nnominal members. \n \n4. This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to \npronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank \nwith its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without prejudice to \nany other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n                                                                                                               (Brij Raj) \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1946                                               Chief General Manager  \n                                                                                           \n \n \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
