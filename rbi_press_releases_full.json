State of the Economy; II. \u2018Making the Horizons Meet\u2019: A \nHeterodox Approach for Short-Term Inflation Forecasting; III. Multivariate Core Trend \nInflation: A New Measure of Core Inflation; IV. Nowcasting GDP in India: A New \nApproach; and V. Seasonality in Key Economic Indicators of India. \n \nI. \nState of the Economy \n \n     Global uncertainty remains elevated, although October witnessed a slight pullback \nafter more than a year of continuous increase. Concerns persist about the heightened \nexuberance in global equity markets, raising questions about its sustainability and its \nimplications for financial stability. The Indian economy showed signs of a further pick \nup in momentum, despite continuing global headwinds. Available high-frequency \nindicators for October suggest a robust expansion in both manufacturing and services \nactivities, supported by festive season demand and the ongoing positive impact of the \nGST reforms. Inflation has moderated to a historic low and remained well below the \ntarget rate. Financial conditions remained benign, and the flow of financial resources \nto the commercial sector increased significantly from a year ago. \n \nII. \n\u2018Making the Horizons Meet\u2019: A Heterodox Approach for Short-Term \nInflation Forecasting \n \nBy Joice John, Saquib Hasan, Renjith Mohan and Suvendu Sarkar \n \n     This article presents a framework for short-term inflation forecasts integrating three \ndiverse procedures: (i) nowcasts (ii) machine learning and statistical methods and (iii) \nsystem of dynamic and stochastic equations, allowing nowcasts in the near end of the \nhorizon to converge to a benchmark forecast. \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 By integrating nowcasts (generated using full-information matrix), benchmark \nforecasts (estimated using machine learning and statistical models), seasonal \nfactors and judgmental adjustments into a dynamic system of disaggregated \ncomponent/sub-group level equations, the proposed framework offers a forward-\nlooking and granular view of inflation dynamics.  \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n\u2022 Pseudo-out of sample root mean square error (RMSE) for year-on-year headline \ninflation is markedly lower in the near-term compared to benchmark forecasts and \nas the horizon extends, it converges to that of the benchmark forecasts. Thus, the \nproposed framework leverages the advantage of nowcasts in the near-term, while \nensuring enhanced forecast accuracy in the shorter horizon. \n\u2022 As such, the forecasting framework provides a powerful, yet pragmatic approach \nfor generating short-term inflation forecasts in an increasingly complex and \nuncertain environment faced by emerging market economies.  \n \nIII. \nMultivariate Core Trend Inflation: A New Measure of Core Inflation \n \nBy Harendra Kumar Behera and Abhishek Ranjan \n  \n     The Multivariate Core Trend (MCT) inflation is a measure of trend inflation which \nprovides insight on whether the inflation dynamics are dominated by a trend common \nacross sectors or are sector-specific, and it has been developed to track persistent \nprice pressures in the economy. The measure looks beyond temporary price swings \nin food and fuel and focuses on lasting inflation trends, making it useful for policy \nassessment. \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 MCT inflation shows greater stability and smoother movements compared to \nheadline and conventional core inflation, especially during periods of large supply \nshocks such as the pandemic and the surge in global commodity prices. \n\u2022 Broad-based price pressures, rather than isolated sector movements, have been \nthe key drivers of underlying inflation in recent years, with services inflation gaining \nimportance. \n\u2022 The new measure improves inflation forecasting over the medium term, offering \npolicymakers an additional tool to monitor inflation dynamics and support decision-\nmaking. \n \nIV. \nNowcasting GDP in India: A New Approach \n \nBy Indrajit Roy and K. M. Neelima \n \n     To gauge the underlying state of the economy, central banks and policy makers \noften track high frequency indicators. In this context, nowcasting has become a useful \ntool for policymakers for summarising the information flowing from different indicators, \nespecially for tracking macroeconomic variables like gross domestic product (GDP) \nfor which data are often released with considerable lags. In this article, a novel two-\nstep approach for nowcasting GDP has been proposed. \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 A primary composite index (PCI) is constructed using selected indicators based on \nthe strength of each indicator in relation to the target variable, i.e, GDP, and a \nsecondary composite index (SCI) is built from the residual information of the \nindicators which are otherwise generally discarded. PCI and SCI are then jointly \nused to nowcast GDP. \n\u2022 The novelty of the new approach lies in i) assigning more weightage to the \nindicators that are correlated with the target series rather than co-movement of the \n3 \n \nindicators among themselves, and ii) maximising information by utilising \ninformation which are often discarded by the conventional modelling process by \ncreating a secondary information source based on residuals. \n\u2022 Incorporating secondary information from residuals has greatly improved accuracy \nof nowcasting GDP when compared with the baseline single-step nowcasting using \ndynamic factor-based modelling (DFM). \n \nV. \nSeasonality in Key Economic Indicators of India \n \nBy Souvik Ghosh, Shivangee Misra, Anirban Sanyal and Sanjay Singh \n \n     This article unveils the seasonal patterns in key economic indicators for India, \nanalysing 78 monthly indicators across six major sectors\u2014monetary and banking, \npayment systems, prices, industrial production, merchandise trade and services\u2014\nalong with 25 quarterly indicators spanning national accounts, balance of payments, \ncapacity utilisation of Indian manufacturing companies and forward-looking enterprise \nsurveys. \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 Banking monthly indicators such as, bank credit, non-food credit and demand \ndeposits typically reach their year-end peak in March.  \n\u2022 Consumer price index experiences seasonal pressure from July to November, \nprimarily due to rising vegetable prices during the monsoon, while fruit prices tend \nto peak in the summer.  \n\u2022 In industrial production, most items hit their highest levels in March, except \nconsumer durables, which peak in October during the festive season. \n\u2022 Both exports and imports reach their seasonal highs in March, with exports \nshowing more pronounced seasonal fluctuations than imports. \n\u2022 Real gross domestic product and gross value added consistently peak in Q4 \n(January-March), with higher seasonal variations since the pandemic. \n\u2022 Private final consumption expenditure and gross fixed capital formation trough in \nQ2 (July-September), whereas government final consumption expenditure \nexperiences seasonal low in Q3 (October-December). Within supply side, \nagriculture experiences maximum seasonal variations. \n\u2022 In the Reserve Bank\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey, manufacturers\u2019 current \nassessment peaks during Q4 (January-March) and expectations scales seasonal \nmaximum in Q3 (October-December). \n\u2022 Services exports peak in Q4, while exports of telecommunications, computer and \ninformation services are strongest in Q3. \n \n    The views expressed in the Bulletin articles are of the authors and do not represent \nthe views of the Reserve Bank of India. \n               \n \n \n               (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1561                                       Chief General Manager \n \n",

Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                    (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1555                                           Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
