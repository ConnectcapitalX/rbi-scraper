It was a \ncombined impact of decrease in foreign-owned assets in India (US$ 29.8 billion) \nand increase in Indian residents\u2019 overseas financial assets (US$ 8.6 billion) \nduring the quarter (Table 1). \n \n\u2022 Accordingly, the ratio of India\u2019s international assets to international liabilities \nimproved to 81.3 per cent as at end-September 2025 from 79.1 per cent a \nquarter ago. The ratio has consistently improved from 71.4 per cent two years \nago and 76.1 per cent a year ago (Chart 1 & Table 1). \n \n\u2022 The decline of all major components of foreign-owned assets in India viz., inward \nportfolio investment (US$ 13.9 billion), direct investment (US$ 8.9 billion) and \nother investment (US$ 7.0 billion) contributed to the overall decline of foreign-\nowned assets in India. \n \n\u2022 Indian residents\u2019 overseas financial assets increased during the quarter, mainly \non the back of higher outward direct investments. \n \n\u2022 Reserve assets stood at US$ 700.1 billion as at end-September 2025 and \naccounted for 58.8 per cent of overseas financial assets of Indian residents \n(Table 2).  \n \n\u2022 The share of debt liabilities in total external liabilities increased marginally to 55.0 \nper cent as at end-September 2025 from 54.3 per cent a quarter ago (Table 3). \n \n \n \n \n \n                    (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1810                                             Chief General Manager \n \n[1] India\u2019s quarterly IIP is disseminated with a lag of one quarter and the previous quarterly IIP for end-June 2025 was \nreleased in the RBI website on September 30, 2025. \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \nTable 1:  Overall International Investment Position of India \n(US$ billion) \nPeriod \nPosition as at end of \nSep-24   \n(PR) \nDec-24 \n(PR) \nMar-25 \n(PR) \nJun-25   \n(PR) \nSep-25 \n(P) \nNet IIP (A-B) \n-353.4 \n-364.0 \n-329.1 \n-312.7 \n-274.3 \nA.
