It was a \ncombined impact of decrease in foreign-owned assets in India (US$ 29.8 billion) \nand increase in Indian residents\u2019 overseas financial assets (US$ 8.6 billion) \nduring the quarter (Table 1). \n \n\u2022 Accordingly, the ratio of India\u2019s international assets to international liabilities \nimproved to 81.3 per cent as at end-September 2025 from 79.1 per cent a \nquarter ago. The ratio has consistently improved from 71.4 per cent two years \nago and 76.1 per cent a year ago (Chart 1 & Table 1). \n \n\u2022 The decline of all major components of foreign-owned assets in India viz., inward \nportfolio investment (US$ 13.9 billion), direct investment (US$ 8.9 billion) and \nother investment (US$ 7.0 billion) contributed to the overall decline of foreign-\nowned assets in India. \n \n\u2022 Indian residents\u2019 overseas financial assets increased during the quarter, mainly \non the back of higher outward direct investments. \n \n\u2022 Reserve assets stood at US$ 700.1 billion as at end-September 2025 and \naccounted for 58.8 per cent of overseas financial assets of Indian residents \n(Table 2).  \n \n\u2022 The share of debt liabilities in total external liabilities increased marginally to 55.0 \nper cent as at end-September 2025 from 54.3 per cent a quarter ago (Table 3). \n \n \n \n \n \n                    (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1810                                             Chief General Manager \n \n[1] India\u2019s quarterly IIP is disseminated with a lag of one quarter and the previous quarterly IIP for end-June 2025 was \nreleased in the RBI website on September 30, 2025. \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \nTable 1:  Overall International Investment Position of India \n(US$ billion) \nPeriod \nPosition as at end of \nSep-24   \n(PR) \nDec-24 \n(PR) \nMar-25 \n(PR) \nJun-25   \n(PR) \nSep-25 \n(P) \nNet IIP (A-B) \n-353.4 \n-364.0 \n-329.1 \n-312.7 \n-274.3 \nA.

However, downside risks persist due to still \nelevated uncertainty, high public debt, and the risk of a disorderly market correction. \n\u2022 Global financial markets appear strong on the surface but show growing underlying \nvulnerabilities. Sharp rise in equities and other risk assets, the expanding role of \nnon-bank financial intermediaries and their deepening interconnectedness with \nbanks, and the growth of stablecoins all heighten global financial system fragilities. \n\u2022 Despite an uncertain and challenging global economic backdrop, the Indian \neconomy continues to grow strongly, underpinned by robust domestic demand, \nbenign inflation, and prudent macroeconomic policies. \n\u2022 The domestic financial system remains robust and resilient, bolstered by strong \nbalance sheets, easy financial conditions, and low financial market volatility. \nNonetheless, there are near-term risks from external uncertainties - geopolitical and \ntrade related.  \n\u2022 The health of the scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) remains sound with strong \ncapital and liquidity buffers, improved asset quality and robust profitability. \n\u2022 Macro stress test results affirm the resilience of SCBs to withstand losses under \nhypothetical adverse scenarios and maintain capital buffers well above the \nregulatory minimum. Stress tests also confirm the resilience of mutual funds and \nclearing corporations. \n\u2022 Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) remain robust supported by strong capital \nbuffers, solid earnings, and improving asset quality. \n\u2022 The insurance sector continues to display balance sheet resilience and the \nconsolidated solvency ratio remained above the minimum threshold limit. \n \n \n                                (Brij Raj)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1807                                                       Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

    "file_extracted_text": " \nDecember 29, 2025 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on The Salem Urban Co-operative Bank Limited, \nTamil Nadu \n \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated December 26, 2025, \nimposed a monetary penalty of \u20b950,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) on The \nSalem Urban Co-operative Bank Limited, Tamil Nadu (the bank) for non-compliance \nwith certain directions issued by RBI on \u2018Framework for Compromise Settlements \nand Technical Write-offs\u2019. This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers \nconferred on RBI under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read with Sections \n46(4)(i) and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by RBI with reference to its \nfinancial position as on March 31, 2025. Based on supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice \nwas issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be \nimposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the \nbank\u2019s reply to the notice and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, \nRBI found, inter alia, that the following charge against the bank was sustained, \nwarranting imposition of monetary penalty: \n \n     The bank had sanctioned non-agricultural loans to members, who had previously \navailed compromise settlements, without adhering to the prescribed minimum cooling \nperiod. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1789                                         Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

This Report presents the performance of the banking sector, \nincluding commercial banks, co-operative banks and non-banking financial \ninstitutions, during 2024-25 and 2025-26 so far. \n \nHighlights \n \n\u2022 \nThe Indian commercial banking sector remained resilient during 2024-25, \nsupported by double-digit balance sheet expansion. Deposits and credit of \nscheduled commercial banks (SCBs) grew in double digits, albeit with a \nmoderation from the previous year. \n \n\u2022 \nThe capital to risk weighted assets ratio of SCBs was 17.4 per cent at end-\nMarch 2025 and 17.2 per cent at end-September 2025. \n \n\u2022 \nAsset quality strengthened further, with the gross non-performing assets \n(GNPA) ratio declining to a multi-decadal low of 2.2 per cent at end-March \n2025 and 2.1 per cent at end-September 2025. \n \n\u2022 \nProfitability of the SCBs remained robust with the return on assets (RoA) at \n1.4 per cent and return on equity (RoE) at 13.5 per cent in 2024-25. During \nH1: 2025-26, RoA and RoE of the SCBs stood at 1.3 per cent and 12.5 per \ncent, respectively. \n \n\u2022 \n The consolidated balance sheet of urban co-operative banks recorded higher \ngrowth in 2024-25 than that in the previous year. Their asset quality improved \nfor the fourth consecutive year, alongside strengthening of their capital buffers \nand profitability.   \n \n\u2022 \n The non-banking financial companies continued to record double digit credit \ngrowth along with robust capital buffers. Their asset quality also improved \nduring the year.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                   (Brij Raj)  \n \n      Press Release: 2025-2026/1786                                     Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
