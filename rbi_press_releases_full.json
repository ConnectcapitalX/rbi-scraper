One of the challenges with speed of cross-border payments is the \ndelay between receipt of the payment at the beneficiary bank and credit to the \nbeneficiary account. This draft circular aims to address some of the frictions for \nfacilitating timely intimation of payment information and credit to the beneficiary\u2019s \naccount. \n \n \n \n \n               (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1410                                        Chief General Manager \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

    "file_extracted_text": " \n October 29, 2025 \n \nCensus on Foreign Liabilities and Assets of Indian Direct Investment  \nEntities for 2024-25  \n \n     Today, the Reserve Bank released the provisional results of the 2024-251 round of the \nannual census on foreign liabilities and assets (FLA) covering cross-border liabilities and \nassets of the Indian entities {viz., companies, limited liability partnerships (LLPs), \nalternative investment funds (AIFs) and partnership firms} with inward/outward direct \ninvestment (DI). \n \n     Out of the 45,702 entities which responded in the latest census, 41,517 reported foreign \ndirect investment (FDI) and/or overseas direct investment (ODI) in their balance sheet for \nMarch 2025. Of these entities, 33,637 had also reported in the previous census round and \n7,880 have newly reported in the current round. Over three-fourths of the companies that \nreported inward direct investment were subsidiaries of foreign companies (i.e., single \nforeign investor holding more than 50 per cent of total equity). \n \n     The census captures detailed information on (a) market value of liabilities and assets of \nIndian DI entities arising on account of cross-border direct and other investments; and (b) \ntrade parameters (viz., activity sector, sales, purchase, exports, and imports), in addition to \nidentification particulars of a reporting entity. The variations in outstanding assets / liabilities \nbetween the beginning and end of a financial year would be different from flows recorded \nin India\u2019s balance of payments (BoP) statistics during the year, as the former would also \ninclude valuation changes due to price and exchange rate movements. \nMain Findings: \n\u2022 More than 97 per cent of the responding DI entities were unlisted in March 2025 and \nthat captured most of the FDI equity capital in India (Tables 1 and 2A).  \n\u2022 Non-financial companies held 90.5 per cent of the FDI equity at face value (Table 2B). \n\u2022 The market value of total FDI in unlisted2 companies surpassed that in listed companies \nas at end-March 2025 (Table 3A). \n\u2022 In terms of market value, the growth of ODI (17.9 per cent) outpaced the growth of FDI \n(11.1 per cent) in India, in rupee terms during 2024-25. As a result, the ratio of inward to \noutward DI stood at 5.9 times in March 2025 as compared to 6.3 time a year ago (Table \n3B). \n \n1 The previous data release in the series, covering 2023-24 census round, was published on October 11, \n2024, on the RBI website. \n2 Market value of equity of unlisted companies is compiled as per the own fund book value (OFBV) method \nprescribed in the Co-ordinated Direct Investment Survey Guide (2015) of the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF).  \n \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n\u2022 Other investment liabilities {viz., trade credit, loans, currency and deposits, and other \npayable with unrelated (third party) non-resident entities} recorded a growth of 7.2 per \ncent during 2024-25 in the US dollar terms. Their corresponding assets also recorded a \ngrowth of 12.5 per cent during the year and covered 46.8 per cent of such liabilities \n(Table 4). \n\u2022 The United States and Singapore together accounted for over one-third of the FDI in \nIndia; other top sources included Mauritius, the United Kingdom and Netherlands. In \ncase of ODI also, Singapore, the United States and the United Kingdom were the top \ndestinations (Tables 5 and 6). \n\u2022 Manufacturing sector accounted for the highest share of total FDI equity capital at market \nvalue (48.4 per cent) as well as at face value (37.8 per cent) (Tables 7 and 8). \n\u2022 The services sector was the second highest shareholder in total FDI equity capital at \nmarket value. Within services sector, more than 73 per cent of the FDI was received by \n\u2018information and communication\u2019 and \u2018financial and insurance activities\u2019 (Table 8). \n \n \n \n \n \n                      (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1408                                              Chief General Manager \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nTable 1: Coverage in FLA Census, 2024-25 \nCategory \nTypes of Entity \nNumber of Entities with Direct Investment \nBoth Inward \nand \nOutward \nOnly \nInward \nOnly \nOutward \nTotal \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \nUnlisted \nForeign Associate companies in India \n536  \n5,698  \n-  \n6,234 \nForeign Subsidiary companies in India \n466  \n25,682  \n-  \n26,148 \nAlternative Investment Funds \n112  \n518  \n21  \n651  \nLLP1 and Partnership Firms \n9  \n1,110  \n774  \n1,893  \nOther companies2 \n-  \n-  \n5,403  \n5,403  \nTotal \n1,123 \n33,008 \n6,198 \n40,329 \nListed \nForeign Associate companies in India \n104 \n142  \n- \n246 \nForeign Subsidiary companies in India \n39  \n82  \n- \n121 \nOther companies \n-  \n-  \n821 \n821 \nTotal \n143 \n224  \n821 \n1,188 \nGrand Total \n1,266 \n33,232  \n7,019  \n41,517 \n1 Limited Liabilities Partnership (LLP) \n2 Includes entities who have only overseas direct investment \n \nTable 2A: Foreign Equity Participation of FDI entities \u2013 Listed and Unlisted \n(amount in \u20b9 crore at face value, end-March 2025) \nCategory \nListed \nUnlisted \nTotal \n(367) \n(34,131) \n(34,498) \nAmount \nper cent \nAmount \nper cent \nAmount \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \nPaid-Up Capital \n53,627 \n4.2 \n12,21,104 \n95.8 \n12,74,731 \n   of which: Equity Capital \n53,279 \n4.3 \n11,96,078 \n95.7 \n12,49,357 \n      of which: FDI Equity Capital \n20,668 \n2.0 \n10,01,437 \n98.0 \n10,22,105 \nNote: \n1.

This penalty \nhas been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of \nSection 47A(1)(c) read with Sections 46(4)(i) and 56 of the BR Act. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by National Bank for \nAgriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) with reference to its financial position \nas on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-compliance with \nstatutory provisions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued \nto the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it \nfor its failure to comply with the said provisions. After considering the bank\u2019s reply to \nthe notice and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter \nalia, that the following charge against the bank was sustained, warranting imposition \nof monetary penalty: \n \n     The bank had failed to transfer eligible unclaimed amounts to the Depositor \nEducation and Awareness Fund within the prescribed time. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in statutory compliance and is not intended to \npronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank \nwith its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without prejudice to \nany other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1368                                        Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

While the LEI uniquely identifies the counterparties to an OTC \nderivative transaction, the UTI serves as a single unique reference number for a \ntransaction. It enables policy makers to obtain a comprehensive view of OTC \nderivatives markets by facilitating global aggregation of transactions. The reporting of \nLEI has been mandated for OTC derivative transactions in most major jurisdictions \nglobally. UTI has also been implemented / is in the process of being implemented in \nmany of the major jurisdictions. In India, LEI has already been implemented. It is now \nproposed to mandate UTI for all OTC derivative transactions.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1367                                       Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

    "file_extracted_text": "1 \n \n \nOctober 20, 2025 \n \nRBI Bulletin \u2013 October 2025 \n     Today, the Reserve Bank released the October 2025 issue of its monthly Bulletin. \nThe Bulletin includes bi-monthly monetary policy statement (October 2025), five \nspeeches, five articles and current statistics.  \n     The five articles are: I. State of the Economy; II. Resilience and Revival: India\u2019s \nPrivate Corporate Sector; III. Fundraising by Indian Small and Medium Enterprises \nthrough IPO: Recent Trends and Developments; IV. Compliance to Confidence: A Data \nQuality Model for Central Banks; and V. Steel Under Siege: Understanding the Impact \nof Dumping on India. \nI. \nState of the Economy \n     Global uncertainty has edged up. In the US, both trade and economic policy \nuncertainty increased in September. Global growth, however, has broadly held up. \nInvestor sentiments dampened in October, on renewed US-China trade tensions and \nprolonged US government shutdown, after a phase of buoyancy. The Indian economy \ndisplayed resilience amidst broader global uncertainty and weak external demand. \nHigh-frequency indicators point to a revival in urban demand and robust rural demand. \nHeadline consumer price index (CPI) inflation moderated sharply in September, \nmarking its lowest reading since June 2017. \nII. \nResilience and Revival: India\u2019s Private Corporate Sector \nBy Snigdha Yogindran, Sukti Khandekar, Rajesh Kavediya and Kamal Gupta \n     The study highlights how India\u2019s private corporates navigated the COVID pandemic \nshock and emerged stronger. Based on financial data of listed non-government non-\nfinancial companies, the study underscores the sector\u2019s ability to withstand global \nshocks with adaptability, profitability, and strengthening of balance sheets in the post-\npandemic period.  \nHighlights: \n\u2022 Corporate sales rebounded sharply post-pandemic, peaking at 32.5 per cent \ngrowth in 2021-22 over the contraction recorded during the pandemic period, \nbefore stabilising at 7.2 per cent in 2024-25. \n\u2022 Net profits rose significantly to \u20b97.1 trillion in 2024-25 from \u20b92.5 trillion in 2020-21. \nConsequently, the net profit margin improved to 10.3 per cent during 2024-25 from \n7.2 per cent in 2020-21.  \n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u093f\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central O\ufb03ce, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n\u2022 Corporates continued to deleverage their balance sheet supported by \ncapitalisation of higher profit, with debt-to-equity ratios improving across firm sizes. \n\u2022 Interest coverage ratio for manufacturing firms improved significantly, reaching 7.7, \non an average during post-COVID period, reflecting robust debt-servicing capacity. \n\u2022 Large firms drove profitability, while medium and small firms demonstrated greater \nimprovement in debt servicing capacity than the large firms.  \nIII. \nFundraising by Indian Small and Medium Enterprises through IPO: Recent \nTrends and Developments \nBy Bhagyashree Chattopadhyay and Shromona Ganguly \n     Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are vital to India\u2019s economic growth, but \noften face constraints in accessing formal finance. In recent years, dedicated SME \nexchanges have emerged as an important platform for fundraising through Initial \nPublic Offerings (IPOs). This article examines the performance and trends of SME \nIPOs in India during FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25, analysing their evolution, market \nbehaviour, and investors\u2019 response. \nHighlights: \n\u2022 \nThe SME IPO market in India saw a sharp surge in activity during FY 2023-24 and \nFY 2024-25, supported by strong retail participation, and favourable market \nsentiment. During most of this time, SME IPOs recorded high oversubscription \nlevels and listing gains.  \n\u2022 \nMacroeconomic and policy factors like overall market buoyancy, and advancement \nin payment and settlement mechanism in the IPO market drove this boom.  \n\u2022 \nMost IPO proceeds were used for capital enhancement or working capital purpose \nby the SMEs. Despite robust listing gain, post-listing performances of these SME \nstocks reveal both opportunities and risks for the investors.  \nIV. \nCompliance to Confidence: A Data Quality Model for Central Banks \nBy Debasis Nandi and Sujeesh Kumar \n     The functioning of the central bank involves collection of huge volume of banking \nand financial sector data from the regulated entities. In the complex data ecosystem, \nensuring the quality of data becomes challenging for central banks. As the central bank \nis entrusted with collection of various type of data - regulatory, supervisory and \nstatistical, this article presents an approach for constructing a data quality index (DQI) \nto evaluate the quality of data submitted by regulated entities.  \nHighlights: \n\u2022 \nThe methodology described in this article outlines a stepwise approach for \nconstructing the DQI using eight data quality dimensions. It broadens upon four \ndata quality dimensions typically applied in the Indian banking supervisory \nlandscape, encompassing data collection and dissemination processes. \n\u2022 \nThe DQI framework provided in this article enables central banks and regulators to \nmonitor and improve data quality systematically enhancing institutional credibility, \nregulatory and supervisory efficiency, and public trust. \n3 \n \n\u2022 \nThe framework highlights the significance of automation in data generation and \ncollection processes for enhancement of data quality in the institutional data \ngovernance. \nV. \nSteel Under Siege: Understanding the Impact of Dumping on India \nBy Anirban Sanyal and Sanjay Singh \n     India's steel sector faced significant headwinds due to cheap imports and dumping \nfrom major global steel producers during 2023-24 and 2024-25. Against the backdrop, \nthis paper analyses the impact of cheap imports on India\u2019s domestic production and \nconsumption of steel at aggregate level. Further, the price sensitivity of steel imports \nis evaluated through average import elasticity across import destinations. \nHighlights: \n\u2022 Steel imports have seen a surge largely driven by lower import price of steel and it \nimpacted the domestic production of steel adversely. \n\u2022 The average price elasticity of India's steel imports varies in the range of 0.73-1.01 \nwhich suggests that given the strong domestic demand of steel products, the \nimport intensity was elevated primarily due to price effects. Lower price point from \nimports led to a substitution of domestically produced steel to meet the elevated \nsteel demand. \n\u2022 The dumping of cheap steel from global producers may pose a risk to the domestic \nsteel production which can be mitigated through suitable policy measures. The \nrecent initiative to impose the safeguard duty provides insulation against the import \ndumping. \n     The views expressed in the Bulletin articles are of the authors and do not represent \nthe views of the Reserve Bank of India. \n \n \n                              \n                (Brij Raj)        \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1355                                             Chief General Manager \n \n",
