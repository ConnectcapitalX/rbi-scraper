    "file_extracted_text": " August 29, 2025 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on Bandhan Bank Limited \n \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated August 26, 2025, \nimposed a monetary penalty of \u20b944.70 lakh (Rupees Forty-Four Lakh and Seventy \nThousand only) on Bandhan Bank Limited (the bank) for contravention of section \n10(1)(b)(ii) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (BR Act), and non-compliance with \ncertain directions issued by RBI on \u2018Automation of Income Recognition, Asset \nClassification and Provisioning processes in banks\u2019. This penalty has been imposed \nin exercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of section 47 A (1) (c) \nread with section 46 (4) of the BR Act. \n \n     The Statutory Inspection for Supervisory Evaluation of the bank was conducted by \nRBI with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2024. Based on \nsupervisory \nfindings \nof \nnon-compliance \nwith \nRBI \ndirections \nand \nrelated \ncorrespondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show \ncause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure to comply with the \nsaid RBI directions.  \n \n     After considering the bank\u2019s reply to the notice and oral submissions made during \nthe personal hearing, RBI found that the following charges against the bank were \nsustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: \n \ni) The bank paid remuneration in the form of commission to certain employees; and \nii) The bank had carried out manual intervention through back-end in respect of data \nof certain accounts and had not captured the audit trails / logs of access with \nspecific user details in the system.  \n \n     The action is based on deficiencies in statutory and regulatory compliance and is \nnot intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered \ninto by the bank with its customers. Further, imposition of monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1006                                             Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
