The existing universe of regulatory \ninstructions issued up to October 9, 2025 have been consolidated into 238 Master \nDirections, across 11 types of regulated entities on up to 30 functions / areas. \nConsequently, approximately 9000 circulars (including Master Circulars / Master \nDirections) administered by the Department of Regulation will be repealed. \n \nA detailed background and explanation of the approach adopted can be found here. \n \n     This exercise is expected to significantly improve the accessibility of regulatory \ninstructions for the regulated entities, thereby reducing their compliance cost. Also, \nconsolidation of regulatory instructions separately for each type of regulated entities \nwill improve the clarity on applicability of each instruction to a regulated entity. \n \n     Accordingly, the Reserve Bank has placed on its website the following sets of \ndraft documents for comments regarding completeness and accuracy: \n \n(i) Drafts of the 238 consolidated Master Directions / Guidelines \n \n(ii) List of the circulars proposed to be repealed \n \n     The comments / feedback may be submitted on or before November 10, 2025 \nthrough the following channels: \n \n(i) The \u2018Connect 2 Regulate\u2019 section on the website by following the \ncorresponding hyperlink provided against each document in the page where \nthey are hosted or \n \n(ii) by email with the subject line \u2018Feedback on <full name of the draft Master \nDirection / Guideline (including the type of Regulated Entity)>\u2019. \n \n     Feedback / suggestions for modification / review of instructions shall not be \nconsidered in this exercise. \n \n \n                     (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1291                                             Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

No. \nSML.DCBS.CRRB.No.S79/02-31-005/2025-2026 dated October 06, 2025, has \nissued certain Directions to The Baghat Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd., Solan, \nwhereby, as from the close of business on October 08, 2025, the bank shall not, \nwithout prior approval of RBI in writing, grant or renew any loans and advances, \nmake any investment, incur any liability including borrowal of funds and acceptance \nof fresh deposits, disburse or agree to disburse any payment whether in discharge of \nits liabilities and obligations or otherwise, enter into any compromise or arrangement \nand sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets except as \nnotified in the RBI Direction dated October 06, 2025, a copy of which has been \ndirected to be displayed on the bank's website / premises for perusal by interested \nmembers of the public. Considering the bank's current liquidity position, the bank has \nbeen directed to permit withdrawal of a sum not exceeding \u20b910,000/- (Rupees Ten \nThousand only) of the total balance held in savings bank or current accounts or any \nother account of a depositor but is allowed to set off loans against deposits subject to \nthe conditions stated in the above RBI Directions. The bank may incur expenditure in \nrespect of certain essential items such as salaries of employees, rent, electricity bills, \netc., as specified in the said Directions. \n \n2. RBI has in the recent past engaged with the Board and Senior Management of the \nbank for improvement in its functioning. However, lack of concrete efforts taken by \nthe bank to address the supervisory concerns and to protect the interest of depositors \nof the bank, necessitated issuance of these Directions.  \n \n3. The eligible depositors would be entitled to receive deposit insurance claim \namount of their deposits up to a monetary ceiling of \u20b95,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakh \nonly) in the same capacity and in the same right, from the Deposit Insurance and \nCredit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), as applicable under the provisions of the \nDICGC Act, 1961, based on submission of willingness by the depositors concerned \nand after due verification. The depositors may contact the bank officials for further \ninformation. Details may also be accessed on the DICGC website: www.dicgc.org.in. \n \n4. The issue of the above Directions by the RBI should not per se be construed as \ncancellation of the banking license by RBI. The bank will continue to undertake \nbanking business subject to restrictions specified in the said Directions till its financial \nposition improves. The RBI continues to monitor the position of the bank and will take \nnecessary actions including modifications of these Directions, as warranted, \ndepending upon circumstances and in the interest of the depositors. \n \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n5.
