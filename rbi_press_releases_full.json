    "file_extracted_text": " \n December 19, 2025 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited \n \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated December 11, 2025, \nimposed a monetary penalty of \u20b961.95 lakh (Rupees Sixty One Lakh Ninety Five \nThousand only) on Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited (the bank) for non-compliance with \ncertain directions issued by RBI on \u2018Access to Banking Services - Basic Savings \nBank Deposit Account\u2019 and \u2018Scope of activities to be undertaken of Business \nCorrespondents (BCs)\u2019 and contravention of provisions of Credit lnformation \nCompanies Rules, 2006 (ClC Rules).  This penalty has been imposed in exercise of \npowers conferred on RBI under the provisions of section 47A(1)(c) read with section \n46(4)(i) of the BR Act and section 25(1)(iii) read with section 23(4) of the Credit \nInformation Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005. \n \n     The Statutory Inspection for Supervisory Evaluation (ISE 2024) of the bank was \nconducted by RBI with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2024. \nBased on supervisory findings of non-compliance with the provisions of RBI \ndirections, CIC rules and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued \nto the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it \nfor its failure to comply with the said provisions of RBI directions and CIC rules. \n  \n     After considering the bank\u2019s reply to the notice and additional submissions made \nby it, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charges against the bank were \nsustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: \n \ni. The bank opened another BSBD account of certain customers who were already \nholding BSBD account in the bank; \nii. The bank entered into an arrangement with BCs for undertaking activities, which \nare not covered within the scope of activities that can be undertaken by BCs; and \niii. The bank furnished inaccurate information, in respect of certain borrowers, to \nCredit Information Companies (CICs). \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in statutory and regulatory compliance and is \nnot intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered \ninto by the bank with its customers. Further, imposition of monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n                    (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1742                                            Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

The MPC members Dr. Nagesh Kumar, Shri Saugata Bhattacharya, Prof. \nRam Singh, Dr. Poonam Gupta and Shri Indranil Bhattacharyya attended the meeting. \n \n6. \n After a detailed assessment of the evolving macroeconomic and financial \ndevelopments and the outlook, the MPC voted unanimously to reduce the policy repo \nrate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) to 5.25 per cent. Consequently, the \nstanding deposit facility (SDF) rate shall stand adjusted to 5.00 per cent and the \nmarginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 5.50 per cent. The MPC \nalso decided to continue with the neutral stance. \n  \nGrowth and Inflation Outlook \n \n7. \nThe global economy is holding up better than expected, though the earlier \nfrontloading of trade is showing signs of normalising. Uncertainty has eased somewhat \nfollowing the end of the US government shutdown and progress on trade agreements, \nyet it remains elevated. Global inflation dynamics remain uneven, with inflation \ntrending above target in most major advanced economies. The US dollar strengthened \nprimarily on safe haven demand while treasury yields remained range bound. Equity \nmarkets remain volatile, driven by shifting views on the monetary policy outlook and \nconcerns surrounding stretched valuations in tech stocks. \n \n8. \nIn India, real gross domestic product (GDP) registered a six-quarter high growth \nof 8.2 per cent in Q2:2025-26, underpinned by resilient domestic demand amidst \nglobal trade and policy uncertainties. On the supply side, real gross value added \n(GVA) expanded by 8.1 per cent, aided by buoyant industrial and services sectors. \nEconomic activity during the first half of the financial year benefited from income tax \nand goods and services tax (GST) rationalisation, softer crude oil prices, front-loading \nof government capital expenditure, and facilitative monetary and financial conditions \nsupported by benign inflation. \n  \n9. \nHigh-frequency indicators suggest that domestic economic activity is holding \nup in Q3, although there are some emerging signs of weakness in a few leading \nindicators. GST rationalisation and festival-related spending supported domestic \ndemand during October-November. Rural demand continues to be robust while urban \ndemand is recovering steadily. Investment activity remains healthy with private \ninvestment gaining steam on the back of expansion in non-food bank credit and high \ncapacity utilisation. Merchandise exports declined sharply in October amid subdued \nexternal demand, accompanied by softer services exports. On the supply side, \nagricultural growth is supported by healthy kharif crop production, higher reservoir \nlevels and better rabi crop sowing. Manufacturing activity continues to improve, and \nthe services sector is maintaining a steady pace. \n  \n10. \nLooking ahead, domestic factors such as healthy agricultural prospects, \ncontinued impact of GST rationalisation, benign inflation, healthy balance sheets of \ncorporates and financial institutions and congenial monetary and financial conditions \nshould continue to support economic activity. Continuing reform initiatives would \nfurther facilitate growth. On the external front, services exports are likely to remain \nstrong, while merchandise exports face some headwinds. External uncertainties \ncontinue to pose downside risks to the outlook, while speedy conclusion of ongoing \ntrade and investment negotiations present upside potential. Taking all these factors \ninto consideration, real GDP growth for 2025-26 is projected at 7.3 per cent, with Q3 \n3 \n \nat 7.0 per cent; and Q4 at 6.5 per cent. Real GDP growth for Q1:2026-27 is projected \nat 6.7 per cent and Q2 at 6.8 per cent (Chart 1). The risks are evenly balanced. \n \n11. \nHeadline CPI inflation declined to an all time low in October 2025. The faster \nthan anticipated decline in inflation was led by correction in food prices, contrary to the \nusual trend witnessed during the months of September-October. Core inflation (CPI \nheadline excluding food and fuel) remained largely contained in September-October, \ndespite continued price pressures exerted by precious metals. Excluding gold, core \ninflation moderated to 2.6 per cent in October. Overall, the decline in inflation has \nbecome more generalised.  \n \n12. \nTurning to the inflation outlook, food supply prospects remain bright on the back \nof higher kharif production, healthy rabi sowing, adequate reservoir levels and \nconducive soil moisture. Barring some metals, international commodity prices are \nlikely to moderate going forward. Overall, inflation is likely to be softer than what was \nprojected in October, mainly on account of the fall in food prices. Considering all these \nfactors, CPI inflation for 2025-26 is now projected at 2.0 per cent with Q3 at 0.6 per \ncent; and Q4 at 2.9 per cent. CPI inflation for Q1:2026-27 and Q2 are projected at 3.9 \nper cent and 4.0 per cent, respectively (Chart 2). In fact, the underlying inflation \npressures are even lower as the impact of increase in price of precious metals is about \n50 basis points (bps).   The risks are evenly balanced. \n \n \n \n \nRationale for Monetary Policy Decisions \n \n13. \nThe MPC noted that headline inflation has eased significantly and is likely to be \nsofter than the earlier projections, primarily on account of the exceptionally benign \nfood prices. Reflecting these favourable conditions, the projections for average \nheadline inflation in 2025-26 and Q1:2026-27 have been further revised downwards. \nCore inflation, which had been rising steadily since Q1:2024-25, eased at the margin \nin Q2:2025-26 and is expected to remain anchored in the period ahead. Both headline \nand core inflation are expected to be around the 4 per cent target during the first half \nof 2026-27. The underlying inflation pressures are even lower as the impact of \nincrease in price of precious metals is about 50 bps.  Growth, while remaining resilient, \nis expected to soften somewhat.  \n4 \n14.\nThus, the growth-inflation balance, especially the benign inflation outlook on\nboth headline and core, continues to provide the policy space to support the growth\nmomentum. Accordingly, the MPC unanimously voted to reduce the policy repo rate\nby 25 bps to 5.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the neutral stance.\nHowever, Prof. Ram Singh was of the view that the stance be changed from neutral\nto accommodative.\n15.\nThe minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on December 19, 2025.\n16.\nThe next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during February 4 to 6, 2026.\nVoting on the Resolution to reduce the policy repo rate to 5.25 per cent \nMember \nVote \nDr. Nagesh Kumar \nYes \nShri Saugata Bhattacharya \nYes \nProf. Ram Singh \nYes \nShri Indranil Bhattacharyya \nYes \nDr. Poonam Gupta \nYes \nShri Sanjay Malhotra \nYes \nStatement by Dr. Nagesh Kumar \n17.\nThe December 2025 MPC Meeting is taking place against the backdrop of\nmixed trends in the Indian economy. The GDP growth in FY2026:Q2 at a robust 8.2%\nexceeded expectations, particularly in the context of a challenging and uncertain\nexternal environment. What was more remarkable about the quarterly growth was its\nacceleration over the past four consecutive quarters, from 6.4% to 7.4%, 7.8%, and\nfinally to 8.2%. After lagging for many quarters, the Q2 growth was led by\nmanufacturing, which grew at over 9%, underpinned by the robust consumption,\nespecially rural consumption, and investment growth. Higher manufacturing growth\naugurs well for jobs-creation. With FY26:H1 having delivered a solid 8%, the full-year\nprojections have been upgraded from 7.0% to around 7.3%. On the other hand,\ninflation not only continued to remain benign but the headline CPI declined further to\n0.3% in October 2025, largely driven by declining food prices. It is in contrast to\nFY25:Q2, when the growth was slowing, but inflation was at relatively high-levels.\n18.\nThe celebrations of this \u2018goldilocks moment\u2019 (high growth, low inflation),\nhowever, were tempered by trends for October 2025 published only a few days later,\nsuggesting that the economic activity had peaked in Q2. The industrial activity, as\nmeasured by Index of Industrial Production began losing momentum in October 2025\nto 14 months low, with mining and quarrying contracting and manufacturing reporting\nonly 1.8% growth. The high-frequency indicators, such as PMI for manufacturing,\ndropped from 59.2 to 56.6. The merchandise exports declined by around 12% in\nOctober 2025. The export orders were at their weakest, bringing the New Orders PMI\nto 13 months low. The rupee came under pressure and breached the psychological\nbarrier of INR90 to a dollar. RBI\u2019s Industrial Outlook Surveys also suggest moderation\nin business assessment and expectations.\n5 \n \n19. \nThere is some evidence that the geopolitical and trade related uncertainties \nhave started to hurt the business sentiment. The Trump tariffs are particularly affecting \nthe labour-intensive industries such as textiles and garments, leather goods, gems & \njewellery, processed food products like shrimp that have a higher exposure to the US \nmarket. These are also the sectors that are dominated by MSMEs and account for a \ndisproportionately larger share (around 40%) of jobs in the manufacturing sector. \nHence, the high tariffs imposed by the US on India have the prospect of affecting \nMSMEs and the jobs in a significant manner, as I had observed at the October 2025 \nMPC. \n \n20. \nTherefore, there is a case for supporting growth through demand stimulus to \npreserve the growth momentum in H2 of 2025-26.  From the fiscal side, the GST 2.0 \nreforms, the Rs 25,060 crores Export Promotion Mission to support diversification of \nmarkets, a Rs 20,000 credit guarantee scheme, and notification of the new labour \ncodes, among other measures, have been announced to support economic growth. \nCoordinated fiscal and monetary policy actions have been very effective in reviving \ngrowth in the past. Hence, the monetary policy could step in to support the growth \nmomentum, given that the transmission of the 100-basis point cut in the repo rate \neffected over the past year in a phased manner, is nearly complete. The headline \ninflation at 0.3% in October 2025, with projections for the full year 2025-26 at 2%, \nprovides space for monetary policy action. Inflationary expectations remain well \nanchored. The current inflation rate is actually too low, breaching the lower bound in \nthe flexible inflation targeting regime, especially if precious metals like gold are \nexcluded. Besides, too low an inflation rate is not healthy for a developing country like \nIndia, suggesting a demand deficit.  \n \n21. \nAgainst that backdrop, I would like to vote for a 25-bps cut in the repo rate to \nsupport the growth momentum, while keeping a status quo on the stance.  \n \nStatement by Shri Saugata Bhattacharya \n \n22. \nThe October 2025 MPC resolution had noted that the then \u201ccurrent \nmacroeconomic conditions and the outlook opened up policy space for further \nsupporting growth\u201d, based primarily on low inflation. Subsequent data on inflation \u2013 \neven lower than forecast \u2013 has further expanded this space, irrespective of the strong \nQ2 FY26 GDP growth print, whose interpretations have been widely debated. \n  \n23. \nInflation has continued to undershoot forecasts. While the low prints have \nlargely emanated from a small set of components, the broader basket of \u201cunderlying\u201d \ninflation too is likely to undershoot the inflation target for many months. In addition, \nthere is little to signal a risk of potential overheating of capacity even if growth \nmomentum were to sustain. Household inflation expectations remain well anchored \nand have responded to the recent sharp drop in inflation.  \n \n24. \nHowever, growth forecasts, both in the resolution and the Survey of \nProfessional Forecasters (SPF), suggest a gradual deceleration. The contraction in \nthe October merchandise export data is concerning, and the trade balance will need \nto be closely monitored. The uncertainty inter alia relating to the trade environment, is \nalso now showing up in a gradual slowdown in certain metrics like the Manufacturing \n(Purchasing Managers Index) PMI, the sales levels readings of the IIM Ahmedabad \n(Business Inflation Expectations Survey) BIES, etc. In addition, as a working \n6 \n \nhypothesis, lower seller pricing power suggested by the expected moderate \n\u201cunderlying\u201d inflation in the near future might not be conducive to investment decisions, \neven if FY26 growth remains close to 7.3% forecast in the resolution.  The expected \ntime for inflation to converge to its target might be longer than growth to its estimated \npotential. Hence, there might be a need for a relative overweight on inflation at this \npoint. \n \n25. \nAnother factor for consideration is transmission. In the October 2025 MPC \nminutes, I had noted that the \"impact of the frontloaded monetary policy actions and \nthe recent fiscal measures is still playing out\", which had prompted me to vote for a \npause.  One component of these effects was transmission into the Weighted Average \nLending Rate (WALR) for both fresh and outstanding Rupee loans, which had then \nbeen ongoing.  Latest data suggests that transmission has been satisfactory and \nbroad based across sectors. Given the RBI commitment to liquidity infusions, further \ntransmission is also likely.  \n \n26. \nBank credit offtake and the broader flow of resources to the commercial sector \nhave been rising over the past few months, specially to both small and medium \nenterprises. This might be reflective of a moderate revival in private investment and a \npickup in economic activity. A further cut in interest rates in the EBLR segments of \nbanks\u2019 loan portfolios (in association with committed further liquidity infusions) is likely \nto boost credit demand, particularly in the MSME segment. This can complement the \ncredit supportive measures (including the macro- and micro-prudential relaxations) \nwhich RBI has progressively announced and notified in the financial sector.  \n  \n27. \nAll things considered, based on the assessed costs and benefits of a rate action \nat this point, the current macroeconomic environment, including inflation and growth \nforecasts factoring in various exogenous drivers of uncertainty, suggests that the \nappropriate risk management action is to err in favour of a policy easing. I, as individual \nmember of the MPC, am risk averse to criticism of having \u201cfallen behind the curve\u201d, \nparticularly the mistake of attributing as \u201ctransient\u201d those drivers of inflation which \nmight ultimately emerge as structural components.  While overall financial conditions \nremain easy, there is an implicit worry that, at the present level, the real policy rate \nmight be slightly more restrictive than warranted by the forecast macro-economic \nconditions in the near term. Notwithstanding my concerns regarding the adverse effect \nof lower interest rates on household savings behaviour, and hence bank deposits, a \npriority now is to overweight growth in the balance of multiple objectives.  \n \n28. \nTo repeat, however, I believe that the cumulative policy rate cuts and liquidity \ninfusions will now have moved the orientation of monetary policy from mildly restrictive \nto balanced. Pending incoming data, I believe the policy interest rate is now consistent \nwith macroeconomic stability. \n   \n29. \nBased on the totality of this assessment, I vote to cut the policy repo rate to \n5.25%, with the caveat that the next actions will be data dependent. Hence, especially \ntaking into account the continuing uncertainty on the external balance, it is prudent to \ncontinue with the neutral stance.  \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nStatement by Prof. Ram Singh \n \n30. \nSince the MPC's October meeting, incoming data on growth-inflation dynamics \nhave provided additional policy space to support the growth momentum. Inflation has \nregistered unprecedentedly low levels with average headline inflation at 1.7 per cent \nfor Q2:2025-26, dipping further to 0.3 per cent in October 2025. Excluding gold, core \ninflation has also moderated to 2.6 per cent. The CPI inflation forecast for the full \nfinancial year 2025-26 is 2.0%. During the first half of 2026-27, both headline and core \ninflation are expected to remain benign relative to the 4 per cent target. With this kind \nof inflation trajectory, the question is not whether, but how much, of a repo rate cut is \npossible without heating the economy. \n \n31. \nMonetary policy easing is warranted on both the inflation and growth fronts, \nindependently. At the current policy rate, the real repo rate of 3.8 per cent for Q2:2025-\n26 was very high. From a forward-looking perspective, the real policy rate over the \nnext three quarters will remain well above what can be considered a growth-supportive \nrate (4.9% in Q3 FY26, 2.6% in Q4 FY26, and 1.6% in Q1 FY27). If we filter out the \neffect of elevated precious metals prices, the real rates are even higher. \n \n32. \nSo, the inflation data itself makes a strong case for an additional rate cut and \nunderscores its urgency A counter-cyclical price-stabilising monetary policy must aim \nto bring prices toward the target as soon as possible. \n \n33. \nA delay in the rate cut would hurt real GDP growth by keeping real interest rates \nunnecessarily above growth-supportive levels. The delay will extend the low-inflation \nphase,  which has important implications  both micro and macro including a less-than-\nexpected nominal GDP growth (estimated at 8.3% for the full FY26, down from the \nbudgeted projection of 10.1%). \n \n34. \nBesides, the prevailing low inflation will squeeze profit margins and increase \nthe real value of debt and interest rates for the private sector. Disinflationary \nexpectations running across several quarters can dampen and defer private-sector \ninvestment even in the short run. As MSMEs' businesses operate in highly competitive \nmarkets and have limited ability to raise prices through the market power channel but \nthe wages tend to be downward sticky,  low inflation is detrimental to their interests as \nwell. \n \n35. \nWill the rate cut heat up the economy? Numbers speak for themselves. \nWhichever way we slice the inflation data, the headline CPI inflation has been on a \ndownward trajectory, even though a substantial part of the transmission expected from \n100 bps repo rate cuts so far has already materialised. The decline is broad-based. \nCore inflation, a crucial indicator of underlying price trends, has remained stable and \nrange-bound. Excluding gold, core inflation moderated to 2.6 per cent in October 2025 \nand is expected to be below 4% for the next 3-4 quarters. According to the World Bank \nCommodity Price Forecasts for October 2025, prices are projected to moderate in \n2026 from 2025 levels, except for some precious metals. International oil prices are \nlooking south.  Even after factoring in the base effect turning adverse for food prices, \na rate cut is unlikely to alter the projected trajectory significantly.  \n \n \n8 \n \n36. \nThe supply side also does not suggest any upward pressure building up. The \nGDP growth rate for recent quarters - Q2 FY 2025-26 at 8.2%, Q1 FY 2025-26 at 7.8% \nand Q4 FY 2024-25 at 7.4% - may appear to be above the trend. At the same time, \nthe projected growth trajectory for the coming four quarters indicates a moderation in \ngrowth from the level achieved in the preceding three quarters. Besides, several \nindicators suggest a slack in the economy.1 Even otherwise, we should not infer from \nthe recent real GDP growth prints that the output gap is positive \u2013 that is, the \neconomy's actual real GDP rate is higher than its maximum sustainable output growth \nrate. Several structural changes underway appear to have increased the potential real \ngrowth rate. \n \n37. \nFor one, the incremental capital\u2013output ratio (ICOR) has come down. So, the \nsame level of additional capital investment produces higher output today than before.2 \nProductivity gains due to fast adoption of technological advances in conjunction with \nrapid expansion of physical and digital infrastructure  (improved digitalisation, better \ninfrastructure (roads, railways and power, among others) over the last decade have \nbeen more pronounced  substantial, especially in construction and the services sector. \nFrom now on, however, structural reforms in the factor markets (labour and land) and \nregulatory easing aimed at improving the efficiency of the capital market are bound to \nraise productivity in the manufacturing sector, putting it on a higher growth-rate path. \nGST 2.0 reforms will also provide a much-needed boost to manufacturing's growth \npotential. Thus, it may well be the case that the output gap is negative - economy is \nstill running below its potential \u2013 an inference corroborated by the trajectory of the core \ninflation excluding gold.  \n   \n38. \nAs the demand for industrial products, the 2025 Household Consumption \nExpenditure Survey (HCES) data paint a clear and encouraging picture for demand \nprospects for the manufacturing sector. During the last decade, rural spending on \ndurable goods has surged by 217%. Demand for durable goods in urban areas has \ngrown even more. This kind of surge in demand for durable goods is likely to be a \nforce multiplier for industrial growth, as Indian households shift to higher-value durable \ngoods. \n \n39. \nDue to these productivity gains and the healthy prospects for domestic demand, \nthe economy can now sustain higher real GDP growth than in the past. To me, a \ngrowth rate above 7.5% appears realistic without building up price pressure. A rate cut \nwill further boost the demand and  help sustain a  high growth rate.  \n \n40. \nIn view of the above, there is a very persuasive case for a 25-basis-point cut in \nthe repo rate.  Filtering out the effect of precious metals in headline CPI and CPI core \n(approximately 50 basis point), or the base effect turning favourable for these metals, \ngives us additional room for a rate cut. However, the decision on the quantum of the \nrate cut should also factor in the challenges on the external front. \n \n \n \n1 The capacity utilisation has reached 74.8% giving a fillip to private capex. But CU needs to improve further for the private capex \nto pick up in full force. In recent months, there has been a moderation in the PMI Manufacturing (to 56.6 in November 2025 a 9-\nmonth low) in growth in index of industrial production (down to 0.4 per cent in October 2025). Electricity demand has remained \nin contractionary zone while steel consumption and cement production have recorded only modest growth rates.   \n2 HDFC estimates suggest that between FY10 and FY19, India\u2019s ICOR has come down from 4.6 to 4.0. Various other sources \nalso, including reports from CRISIL, the SBI, and economic think tanks like ICRIER, provide evidence that India's incremental \ncapital-output ratio (ICOR) has come down in recent years, indicating improved capital efficiency.  \n9 \n \n41. \nExports will continue to face headwinds from uncertainty related to US tariffs \nand competition from Chinese exports. On the one hand, the latter put strain on the \nprospects for Indian exports. On the other hand, China\u2019s strategy of exporting its vast \nexcess domestic capacity acts as a global inflation stabiliser, exerting downward \npressure on global goods prices. Together, these effects also strengthen the case for \ndemand-supportive rate cuts without compromising the predictability of the inflation \ntrajectory. \n \n42. \nHowever, a rate cut can add to the pressure on the INR. The Real Effective \nExchange Rate (REER) for INR has fallen substantially due to FPI outflows triggered \nby global financial market uncertainty and less appealing price-earnings ratios for \nIndia. However, the economy\u2019s fundamentals \u2013 BOP, Forex, fiscal deficit, debt-to-GDP \nratio, corporate and bank balance sheets, inflation, and growth dynamics \u2013 are all \nrobust. Therefore, I expect exchange pressures and FPI flows to be self-limiting. As \nsuch, the depreciation is unlikely to cause imported inflation due to low oil and \ncommodity prices - international pricing benchmark Brent crude (BZ=F) has fallen to \na lowest level in recent times and World Bank\u2019s CPF has projected most prices to \nmoderate in 2026. \n \n43. \nOverall, given the uncertainty on the external front, it seems prudent to go for \nonly a 25-basis-point cut at this point. Additionally, in view of the dormancy in the price \nmomentum underlying headline CPI and CPI core, and the case for supporting growth \nmomentum, the rate cut should be accompanied by a change in stance to \n\u201caccommodative\u201d.  \n \nStatement by Shri Indranil Bhattacharyya \n \n44. \nThe global economy remained robust in 2025 as evident from upward revision \nin growth projections3 but lingering uncertainties and persisting fragilities continue to \ncloud its outlook. In this milieu, growth in India surprised on the upside at 8.0 per cent \nin H1:2025-26, powered by both fiscal activism and monetary stimulus \u2013 rate cuts and \nliquidity injections \u2013 in an environment of benign inflation. While domestic tailwinds \n(GST cut, easy financial conditions) continue to support growth, external headwinds \nfrom the trade and tariff-related uncertainties are acting as a dampener. Illustratively, \nwhile merchandise exports contracted by around 12 per cent in October 2025, exports \nto the US declined by 8.6 per cent. In terms of outlook, although high frequency \nindicators suggest that the economy is holding its course in Q3, few leading indicators \npoint towards a deceleration in momentum in the period ahead. Accordingly, growth \nis projected to moderate from H1:2025-26 to about 6.8 per cent each in H2 and \nH1:2026-27. \n  \n45. \n In contrast to growth, inflation surprised on the downside by plummeting to 0.3 \nper cent (lowest level in the current CPI series) in October 2025. Moderation of \nheadline inflation by about 180 bps during September-October was faster than \nanticipated and was primarily driven by the deflation in food prices. Although core \ninflation remained rangebound at around 4 per cent, it was powered by the \ndisproportionate impact of rising prices of precious metals (gold and silver). Core \nexcluding precious metals recorded a muted momentum with seasonally adjusted \n \n3 In October, the IMF raised its 2025 global growth forecast by 20 bps to 3.2 per cent, due to lower than anticipated negative \nimpact of tariff. \n10 \n \nannualised rates averaging 2.0 per cent during Q2:2025-26 and turning negative in \nOctober, partly reflecting the rationalisation of GST rates. CPI diffusion index, which \ntracks the extent of generalisation of price pressures, declined to its lowest level in \nOctober since the COVID-19 pandemic.4 The benign inflation scenario is likely to \nprolong, as reflected in the trimming of the CPI inflation forecast by 60 bps each for \n2025-26 and Q1 2026-27 to 2.0 per cent and 3.9 per cent, respectively. The forecast \nof 4.0 per cent in Q2:2026-27 indicates eventual alignment of headline inflation with \nthe target. During this period, core inflation (excluding precious metals) is likely to \nremain well-below the target. \n \n46. \nGiven the above context, I vote for a 25-bps rate cut based on the following \nconsiderations. First, flexible inflation targeting derives credibility from predictable \npolicy responses based on the current state of the economy, while retaining the \nflexibility to use discretion during exceptional circumstances.5 In the Indian context, \nthe credibility of monetary policy is reinforced by a firm commitment to the 4 per cent \ninflation target. In the current context, when muted inflation outlook, both in terms of \nthe trajectory of headline and core (excluding precious metals), suggests absence of \ndemand pressures, the MPC ought to support growth, particularly when it is projected \nto decelerate going ahead. This is also consistent with the MPC communication in \nOctober of acting on policy space provided by lower than projected inflation prints. \nSecond, calibrated policy easing, as being done since February 2025, supports output \nstabilisation as failure of policy to adjust to evolving conditions can increase \nmacroeconomic volatility.6 This, however, has not resulted in compromising price \nstability, as inflation expectations have also moderated in line with the decline in \ninflation. Finally, given the neutral stance of policy, lower realised inflation and a \ndownward revision in the inflation forecast warrants downward adjustments in the \nnominal policy rate. I also support retaining the neutral stance as it preserves the \nflexibility to respond judiciously to the evolving situation by remaining data dependent \nwhile avoiding the pitfalls of precommitment in an uncertain environment.  \n \nStatement by Dr. Poonam Gupta \n  \n47. \nThe last two months since the October policy have been momentous, with the \nfollowing three developments holding particular relevance. First, the global economy \nhas held up well despite prevailing uncertainties. No new shocks have emerged on \nthe global front during this period. One could perhaps safely conclude that the global \nuncertainties have peaked. \n  \n48. \nSecond, the recent economic momentum has not just sustained but has even \nimproved, as borne out in the data for Q2:2025-26 (real GDP growth rate accelerating \nto 8.2 per cent). The high frequency indicators for Q3 thus far seem to be holding up. \nIndications are that the growth outcomes during the second half of the year may \nmoderate from the elevated levels of H1 but would continue to remain strong. \n \n  \n \n4 The cumulative weight of items that recorded an annual inflation of below four per cent has increased to about 80 per cent in \nOctober indicating that inflation moderation has been comprehensive across items. \n5 For a detailed discussion on the role of rule versus discretion within Inflation Targeting framework, see Bernanke, B. S., & \nMishkin, F. S. (1997). Inflation targeting: A new framework for monetary policy. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 11(2), 97\u2013116. \n6 Role of output stabilisation under inflation targeting is discussed in Svensson, L. E. O. (2010). Inflation targeting. In B. M. \nFriedman & M. Woodford (Eds.), Handbook of Monetary Economics (Vol. 3B, pp. 1237\u20131302). Elsevier. \n11 \n \n49. \nThird, inflation dynamics have been more benign than were earlier projected. \nInflation has been below the 4 per cent target for the last nine months averaging 2.3 \nper cent and is likely to remain well contained for at least nine more months. The \naverage inflation for 2025-26 is projected to be 2.0 per cent, down by 60 bps from the \nOctober policy. \n \n50. \nThe most crucial recent development from the perspective of monetary policy \nhas been the faster than anticipated moderation in CPI headline inflation. Under the \ncurrent Flexible Inflation Targeting Framework, the mandate is price stability (an \ninflation target of 4 per cent within a band of 2 to 6 per cent) keeping in mind the \nobjective of growth. Therefore, even if the MPC members traditionally consider a \nwhole host of factors in their decisions, but when the prevailing inflation and its forecast \nis as low as it is currently - it alone ought to get a larger weight in the monetary policy \ndeliberations. \n   \n51. \nTherefore, I vote for a rate cut of 25 bps.  \n \n52. \nOne may ask whether the current rate cut, resulting in a cumulative rate cut of \n125 bps, could lead to overheating in the economy. However, not just headline and \ncore inflation, but most other nominal indicators of the economy are prevailing at levels \nthat indicate that the economy at this point is not showing any signs of overheating. \nInstead, one could interpret the data as indicating that there is slack in the economy. \n  \n53. \nAs for the stance, I propose to retain it at neutral. In other words, let any future \ncourse of policy action be totally data dependent.  \n \nStatement by Shri Sanjay Malhotra \n \n54. \nGlobal growth has remained resilient during the year but persisting risks from \ngeopolitical and trade tensions, policy uncertainty, and economic fragmentation \ncontinue to temper its outlook. Receding inflation pressures, although above targets \nin some advanced economies, open up the scope for more accommodative policies in \nthe ensuing months. Financial market sentiments remain circumspect, conditioned by \nlingering uncertainties on divergent policy paths of major central banks, and regional \ndisparities in macroeconomic outcomes. \n \n55. \nDomestically, H1 witnessed strong growth, driven by several positive domestic \nfactors viz., direct and indirect tax rationalisation, monetary easing, conducive financial \nconditions and benign inflation. Although domestic economic activity remains resilient \nin Q3, weakness in some leading high-frequency indicators is suggestive of a \ndeceleration in the growth momentum in H2 vis-\u00e0-vis H1. Overall, real GDP growth is \npoised to exceed 7 per cent, much above our expectation of 6.5 per cent at the \nbeginning of the year, as healthy domestic prospects outweigh the concerns on the \nexternal front. Going forward in H1 next year, domestic growth is projected to remain \nstrong, though moderate to 6.7-6.8 per cent. \n \n56. \nAt the same time, headline inflation in H1:2025-26 turned out to be much softer \nthan anticipated due to the generalised moderation in price pressures, particularly the \nsharp decline in food prices. Moreover, core inflation (CPI headline excluding food and \nfuel) remained rangebound notwithstanding the continued increase in prices of \nprecious metals. In fact, core inflation excluding precious metals, has been low for a \n12 \n \nlong time. Since the beginning of 2024, it has been in the range of 2.5 to 3.4 per cent. \nGoing ahead, good agricultural production, low food prices and exceptionally benign \ninternational commodity price outlook suggest that headline inflation for the full year \n(2025-26) is likely to be around 2 per cent, half of what was projected at the beginning \nof the year. Headline inflation is projected to be close to the 4 per cent target in \nH1:2026-27. Excluding precious metals, inflation is likely to be much lower, as has \nbeen the trend since the beginning of 2024. \n \n57. \nThus, demand pressures, as evident from low core inflation (excluding precious \nmetals), are minimal and projected to remain low in the next three quarters. \nConsidering the benign inflation outlook \u2013 headline as well as core - real interest rates \nneed to be lower. Therefore, I vote for a 25-bps rate cut. This will also stimulate \ndemand and be growth-supportive. Moreover, I am in favour of retaining the neutral \nstance which gives the requisite flexibility to remain data-dependent and act according \nto the evolving macroeconomic conditions and outlook. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      (Brij Raj)             \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1739                                            Chief General Manager \n",

No. \nAMD.DOS.SSM.No.S831/11-03-153/2025-2026 dated December 17, 2025 has \nissued certain Directions to The Valsad Mahila Nagrik Sahakari Bank Ltd., Valsad, \nGujarat, (\u201cthe bank\u201d), whereby, as from the close of business on December 18, \n2025, the bank shall not, without prior approval of RBI in writing, grant or renew any \nloans and advances, make any investment, incur any liability including borrowal of \nfunds and acceptance of fresh deposits, disburse or agree to disburse any payment \nwhether in discharge of its liabilities and obligations or otherwise, enter into any \ncompromise or arrangement and sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its \nproperties or assets except as notified in the RBI Direction dated December 17, \n2025, a copy of which has been directed to be displayed on the bank's website / \npremises for perusal by interested members of the public. Considering the bank's \npresent liquidity position, the bank has been directed not to allow withdrawal of any \namount from savings bank or current accounts or any other account of a depositor \nbut is allowed to set off loans against deposits subject to the conditions stated in the \nabove RBI Directions. The bank may incur expenditure in respect of certain essential \nitems such as salaries of employees, rent, electricity bills, etc., as specified in the \nsaid Directions. \n2. These Directions are necessitated due to supervisory concerns emanating from \nthe recent material developments in the bank, and to protect the interests of \ndepositors of the bank. RBI has in the recent past engaged with the Board and \nSenior Management of the bank for improvement in its functioning. However, lack of \nconcrete efforts taken by the bank to address the supervisory concerns and to protect \nthe interest of depositors of the bank, necessitated issuance of these Directions.  \n3. The eligible depositors would be entitled to receive deposit insurance claim \namount of their deposits upto a monetary ceiling of \u20b95,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakh \nonly) in the same capacity and in the same right, from the Deposit Insurance and \nCredit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), as applicable under the provisions of the \nDICGC Act, 1961, based on submission of willingness by the depositors concerned \nand after due verification. The depositors may contact the bank officials for further \ninformation. Details may also be accessed on the DICGC website: www.dicgc.org.in. \n4. The issue of the above Directions by the RBI should not per se be construed as \ncancellation of the banking license by RBI. The bank will continue to undertake \nbanking business subject to restrictions specified in the said Directions till its financial \nposition improves. The RBI continues to monitor the position of the bank and will take \nnecessary actions including modifications of these Directions, as warranted, \ndepending upon circumstances and in the interest of the depositors. \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n5.

After considering the bank\u2019s reply to the notice and \noral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the \nfollowing charges against the bank were sustained, warranting imposition of \nmonetary penalty: \n \nThe bank had: \ni. \nfailed to transfer 20% of its net profit for financial years 2022-23, 2023-24 and \n2024-25 to the Statutory Reserve; \nii. \nsanctioned loans in excess of the prescribed regulatory limit to certain nominal \nmembers;  \niii. \nsanctioned gold loans under bullet repayment scheme beyond the prescribed \nregulatory limit;  \niv. \nopened accounts, which were non-compliant with KYC requirements; and  \nv. \nfailed to upload the KYC records of customers onto Central KYC Records \nRegistry (CKYCR) within the prescribed timeline. \n \nThis action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to \npronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank \nwith its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without prejudice to \nany other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n                 (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1732                                          Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

The bank may \nincur expenditure in respect of certain essential items such as salaries of employees, \nrent, electricity bills, etc., as specified in the said Directions. \n \n2. RBI has in the recent past engaged with the Board and Senior Management of the \nbank for improvement in its functioning. However, lack of concrete efforts taken by \nthe bank to address the supervisory concerns and to protect the interest of depositors \nof the bank, necessitated issuance of these Directions.  \n \n3. The eligible depositors would be entitled to receive deposit insurance claim \namount of their deposits up to a monetary ceiling of \u20b95,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakh \nonly) in the same capacity and in the same right, from the Deposit Insurance and \nCredit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), as applicable under the provisions of the \nDICGC Act, 1961, based on submission of willingness by the depositors concerned \nand after due verification. The depositors may contact the bank officials for further \ninformation. Details may also be accessed on the DICGC website: www.dicgc.org.in. \n \n4. The issue of the above Directions by the RBI should not per se be construed as \ncancellation of the banking license by RBI. The bank will continue to undertake \nbanking business subject to restrictions specified in the said Directions till its financial \nposition improves. The RBI continues to monitor the position of the bank and will take \nnecessary actions including modifications of these Directions, as warranted, \ndepending upon circumstances and in the interest of the depositors. \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n5.

    "file_extracted_text": " \n December 15, 2025 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on The Kovilpatti Co-operative Urban Bank \nLimited, Tamil Nadu \n \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated December 10, 2025, \nimposed a monetary penalty of \u20b91 lakh (Rupees One lakh only) on The Kovilpatti Co-\noperative Urban Bank Limited, Tamil Nadu (the bank) for non-compliance with certain \ndirections issued by RBI on \u2018Prudential Norms on Capital Adequacy - Primary \n(Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs)\u2019. This penalty has been imposed in exercise of \npowers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read with \nSections 46(4)(i) and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by RBI with reference to its \nfinancial position as on March 31, 2025. Based on supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice \nwas issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be \nimposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the \nbank\u2019s reply to the notice and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, \nRBI found, inter alia, that the following charges against the bank were sustained, \nwarranting imposition of monetary penalty: \n \n     The bank had allowed the refund of share capital to its members and sanctioned \ncertain loans without complying with the share linking to borrowing norms, despite its \nCRAR being less than the regulatory minimum. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n                 (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1703                                          Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

This penalty has been imposed in \nexercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read \nwith Sections 46(4)(i) and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and Section 25 \nread with Section 23 of the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by Reserve Bank of India with \nreference to its financial position as on March 31, 2025. Based on supervisory \nfindings of non-compliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that \nregard, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty \nshould not be imposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After \nconsidering the bank\u2019s reply to the notice and oral submissions made during the \npersonal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charges against the bank \nwere sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: \n  \nThe bank had:  \ni. \nincurred capital expenditure without prior approval of RBI in non-adherence to \ndirections under SAF; and \nii. \nfailed to submit credit information of its customers to all the four Credit \nInformation Companies. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                    (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1685                                         Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
