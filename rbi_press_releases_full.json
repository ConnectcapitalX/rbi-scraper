Although financial market \nvolatility and geopolitical uncertainties have abated somewhat from their peaks in \nrecent months, trade negotiation challenges continue to linger. Global growth, though \nrevised upwards by the IMF, remains muted. The pace of disinflation is slowing \ndown, with some advanced economies even witnessing an uptick in inflation. \n8. \nDomestic growth remains resilient and is broadly evolving along the lines of \nour assessment. Private consumption, aided by rural demand, and fixed investment, \nsupported by buoyant government capex, continue to boost economic activity. On the \nsupply side, a steady south-west monsoon is supporting kharif sowing, replenishing \nreservoir levels and boosting agriculture activity. Moreover, services sector and \nconstruction activity remain robust. However, growth in industrial sector remained \nsubdued and uneven across segments, pulled down by electricity and mining.  \n9. \nAs for the growth outlook, the above normal southwest monsoon, lower \ninflation, rising capacity utilization and congenial financial conditions continue to \nsupport domestic economic activity. The supportive monetary, regulatory and fiscal \npolicies including robust government capital expenditure should also boost demand. \nThe services sector is expected to remain buoyant, with sustained growth in \nconstruction and trade in the coming months. Prospects of external demand, \nhowever, remain uncertain amidst ongoing tariff announcements and trade \nnegotiations. The headwinds emanating from prolonged geopolitical tensions, \npersisting global uncertainties, and volatility in global financial markets pose risks to \nthe growth outlook. Taking all these factors into account, projection for real GDP \ngrowth for 2025-26 has been retained at 6.5 per cent, with Q1 at 6.5 per cent, Q2 at \n6.7 per cent, Q3 at 6.6 per cent, and Q4 at 6.3 per cent. Real GDP growth for \nQ1:2026-27 is projected at 6.6 per cent (Chart 1). The risks are evenly balanced. \n10. \nCPI headline inflation declined for the eighth consecutive month to a 77-month \nlow of 2.1 per cent (y-o-y) in June 2025. This was driven primarily by a sharp decline \nin food inflation led by improved agricultural activity and various supply side \nmeasures. Food inflation recorded its first negative print since February 2019 at (-) \n0.2 per cent in June. High-frequency price indicators signal a continuation of the \nlower price momentum in food prices this year to July as well. Core inflation, which \nremained within a narrow range of 4.1-4.2 per cent during February-May, increased \nto 4.4 per cent in June, driven partly by a continued increase in gold prices. \n11. \nThe inflation outlook for 2025-26 has become more benign than expected in \nJune. Large favourable base effects combined with steady progress of the southwest \nmonsoon, healthy kharif sowing, adequate reservoir levels and comfortable buffer \nstocks of foodgrains have contributed to this moderation. CPI inflation, however, is \nlikely to edge up above 4 per cent by Q4:2025-26 and beyond, as unfavourable base \neffects, and demand side factors from policy actions come into play. Barring any \nmajor negative shock to input prices, core inflation is likely to remain moderately \nabove 4 per cent during the year. Weather-related shocks pose risks to inflation \noutlook. Considering all these factors, CPI inflation for 2025-26 is now projected at \n3.1 per cent with Q2 at 2.1 per cent; Q3 at 3.1 per cent; and Q4 at 4.4 per cent. CPI \ninflation for Q1:2026-27 is projected at 4.9 per cent (Chart 2). The risks are evenly \nbalanced. \n3 \n \n \n \n \nRationale for Monetary Policy Decisions \n12. \nThe MPC noted that the inflation outlook in the near term has become more \nbenign than anticipated earlier, and the average CPI inflation this year is expected to \nremain significantly below the target. This is driven mainly by lower food inflation that \nentered deflationary territory in June. However, CPI inflation is likely to edge up \nabove the 4 per cent target from Q4:2025-26 onwards. Moreover, core inflation has \nbeen rising steadily from the recent low of 3.6 per cent recorded during December-\nJanuary 2024-25 and averaged 4.3 per cent in Q1 this year. Core excluding precious \nmetals has witnessed an uptick and averaged 3.4 per cent in Q1. \n13. \nGrowth has held up well with some pick-up expected in the coming festive \nseason and is evolving in line with our assessment of 6.5 per cent for 2025-26.  \n14. \nThus, while headline inflation is much lower than projected earlier, it is mainly \ndue to volatile food prices, especially of vegetables. Core inflation, on the other hand, \nhas remained steady around the 4 per cent mark, as anticipated. Inflation is projected \nto go up from the last quarter of this financial year. Growth is robust and as per \nearlier projections though below our aspirations. The uncertainties of tariffs are still \nevolving. Monetary policy transmission is continuing. The impact of the 100 bps rate \ncuts since February 2025 on the economy is still unfolding. \n15. \nOn balance, therefore, the current macroeconomic conditions, outlook and \nuncertainties call for continuation of the policy repo rate of 5.5 per cent and wait for \nfurther transmission of the front-loaded rate cuts to the credit markets and the \nbroader economy. Accordingly, the MPC unanimously voted to keep the repo rate \nunchanged. The MPC further resolved to maintain a close vigil on the incoming data \nand the evolving domestic growth-inflation dynamics to chart out the appropriate \nmonetary policy path. Accordingly, all members decided to continue with the neutral \nstance. \n16. \nThe minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on August 20, 2025. \n17. \nThe next meeting of the MPC is scheduled from September 29 to October 1, \n2025. \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nVoting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 5.5 per cent \n \nMember \nVote \nDr. Nagesh Kumar \nYes \nShri Saugata Bhattacharya \nYes \nProf. Ram Singh \nYes \nDr. Rajiv Ranjan \nYes \nDr. Poonam Gupta \nYes \nShri Sanjay Malhotra \nYes \n \nStatement by Dr. Nagesh Kumar \n18. \nThe MPC held its August meeting against the backdrop of continued \nchallenges to the sustainability of economic growth, especially in the manufacturing \nsector, posed by the trade policy uncertainties and subdued private investment, while \ninflationary pressures have eased further.  \n19. \nThe inflationary outlook has continued to remain benign. The CPI headline has \nsoftened further in June 2025 to 2.1 per cent, the lowest level since January 2019, \ndriven by declining food prices, which went into negative territory at -0.2% on a y-o-y \nbasis. The inflationary expectations remain well anchored as the RBI household \nsurveys confirm the continued easing of inflationary expectations. Hence, the \nprojections for headline CPI for 2025 have been revised downwards by 60 basis \npoints from 3.7% at the time of June Policy to 3.1% now. \n20. \nThe economic growth outlook remains challenging. Despite healthy growth of \nprofits and profit margins, and capacity utilisation rates trending upwards and staying \nabove the 75% level (including the seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation), \nconsidered a critical threshold, especially for manufacturing, the sales growth \nmoderated, and private investment is not showing signs of picking up. The credit \nofftake has also not happened in the expected manner, despite lower interest rates. \nThe urban demand continues to remain subdued, although rural demand is showing \nhealthy growth, led by rising rural wages, robust agricultural growth with the \nprospects of a good monsoon.  \n21. \nThe private investment sentiment is adversely affected by the trade policy \nuncertainties. While the signing of the UK-India FTA is an important positive \ndevelopment, the US announcement of 25% tariffs on India is causing a lot of anxiety \nabout the economic outlook. The preliminary calculations suggest that these tariffs \nmay hurt the growth rate in the current year by 20 to 30 basis points but given the \nfact that the US is a major market for India\u2019s exports of labour-intensive goods such \nas textiles and garments, leather goods, gems and jewellery, shrimp among other \nfood products, the threat of job losses is more serious. One can only hope that the \npenal tariffs for Russian oil purchase will be withdrawn and the ongoing bilateral trade \nnegotiations will succeed in eventually bringing down the US tariffs on Indian exports \nto more manageable levels and broadly in line, if not better, with the Asian peers, \nsuch as ASEAN countries and Bangladesh and the disruption will be short-lived. \nHowever, the uncertainty is affecting the investment climate. Going forward, \ndiversification of markets for goods will be important. In that context, the negotiations \nof the India-EU FTA need to be expedited and the FTAs or the comprehensive \neconomic partnership agreements with Japan and the Republic of Korea need to be \nreviewed to make them more effective, especially for the export of labour-intensive \ngoods. Tapping the domestic market fully for the finished consumer goods by \nreducing the dependence on imports would also be helpful. Enhancing the domestic \nvalue addition in consumer goods exports through building the globally known Indian \n5 \n \nbrands and supply chains, including through overseas direct investments (ODI) and \nacquisitions of foreign retail chains, would also be important. \n22. \nKeeping in mind the compulsions to support economic growth, the repo rate \nhas been lowered three times since the February 2025 MPC meeting bringing a total \nof 100 basis points reduction. Transmission of the repo rate cuts to the lending and \ndeposit rates happens with a lag. However, the transmission was accelerated by the \nhefty 50 basis point cut in June 2025 policy. By now, overall, the lending rates have \ngone down by 71 basis points, and the deposit rates by 87 basis points for fresh \nloans and deposits. Given the lag in transmission, further softening of lending rates \nmay happen in the coming months, especially given that liquidity continues to remain \nin surplus.  \n23. \nWhile the case for stimulating private investments and urban demand remains, \nand the benign inflation outlook provides policy space, we may wish to wait and \nwatch as the transmission of the existing actions takes place and how the trade \npolicy uncertainties play out before considering policy actions at the October meeting \nof the MPC. Hence, I vote for keeping the repo rate unchanged at this juncture. I also \nfeel that we could continue with the neutral stance to keep our options open in this \nchallenging and complex economic environment.  \n  \nStatement by Shri Saugata Bhattacharya \n24. \nThe MPC has been pro-active in easing monetary policy since February 2025, \nin conjunction with multiple RBI measures to reinforce transmission and ease lending \nconditions. The policy repo rate has been cut by 100 basis points in the space of 5 \nmonths. Average system liquidity has been in Rs 3.0 lakh crores surplus since the \nJune 2025 MPC meeting, and the pre-emptive guidance of a 100 basis points cut in \nthe CRR starting September is expected to keep liquidity in surplus. Financial \nconditions, as reflected in RBI data, remain easy.  \n25. \nAt this point, we need to step back, assess the impacts of the rate decisions \nand other policy actions. As trite as this sounds, it is worth re-emphasising that \nmonetary policy has to address multiple, often conflicting, objectives and optimise the \nconsequent trade-offs.  \n26. \nThe most important of these trade-offs, to my mind, is the balance between \nloan and deposit rates. The intervening period from June 2025 has seen a fairly large \ntransmission of the policy easing into credit interest rates, particularly for fresh loans. \nTo reiterate, one of the principal objectives of monetary policy easing is to lower \nborrowing costs to support investment intent and decisions. This can presumably \nfacilitate increased demand for credit. To an extent, this has happened. Bank credit \nflows to the micro and small enterprises (as of 27th June) have largely held up. More \nbroadly, overall flows of funds to the commercial sector, via both domestic and \noffshore channels, have also been robust.  \n27. \nDuring this same period, though, interest rates on fresh deposits have fallen \nmore sharply than on fresh loans. Prima facie, this likely would have primarily been \ndriven by cuts in wholesale deposits rates, due to the large liquidity surplus. Even \nfactoring in the underlying deposit mix, this fall in deposit rates is of some concern \nregarding the accretion of domestic household savings, given my conjecture about \nrestricted foreign savings (capital) flows into India, at least in the near future. \n28. \nBuilding on the credit narrative, domestic economic activity, based on high \nfrequency indicators, remain largely resilient, despite moderation in some proxies of \naggregate demand. RBI Survey responses indicate continuing consumer confidence. \nInflation forecasts over the next couple of quarters in FY26 are moderate, but are \nprojected to rise thereafter. In addition, the sources of the moderation in recent \n6 \n \ninflation prints originate from a concentrated subset of the index, which is a latent \nrisk. This is the second trade-off.  \n29. \nAs to the broader macroeconomic environment, uncertainty about global trade \nand economic activity remains elevated, even though the emerging scope and scale \nof US tariffs are becoming somewhat clearer. Despite this, uncertainty about global \nsupply chain dislocations remains heightened. The outlook on India-US trade, in \nparticular, has become fraught, based on the publicly available information on India-\nspecific US tariffs plus unknown additional penal tariffs. Geo-strategic considerations \nhave thus added another layer of uncertainty. The outcome and timelines of a \nbilateral trade deal with the US are unclear. If these tariffs persist, there is likely to be \nan adverse impact on India growth in FY26, and probably beyond. All these have \nclouded the outlook on India\u2019s external balance, both current and capital accounts. \nThe balance between the domestic economic dynamics and the offshore uncertainty \nis the third trade-off.  \n30. \nGiven this level of extant and evolving uncertainty, it is difficult to provide even \na modicum of forward guidance. Policy decisions will continue to be based on \nincoming data and be taken on a meeting-by-meeting basis. While the current trade \ndynamics play out, data on economic data on activity in India in the recent past, \nnotably Q1 FY26 GDP and Balance of Payments, are also awaited.  \n31. \nHence, given the fluidity of the macro-financial environment, coupled with the \nambiguities in the information set presently available, I believe that a pause in \nmonetary policy decisions, both on the repo rate and the stance is appropriate. \nHence, I vote for status quo in this MPC meeting. \n \nStatement by Prof. Ram Singh \n32. \nI will make a brief statement about the August 2025 meeting, as my \nassessment of the current growth-inflation dynamics and the prospects is very similar \nto what is described in the MPC statement. I will avoid duplicating the data presented \nin the MPC statement. \nInflation  \n33. \nThe CPI headline inflation has continued on its downward trajectory during the \nlast two quarters, almost touching the floor of the tolerance band in June. The \nunexpected drop in CPI inflation has been driven primarily by a sharp decline in food \ninflation that registered its first negative print in June 2025 at (-) 0.2 per cent, the \nlowest since February 2019. Decline in food inflation is broad-based. The high-\nfrequency indicators signal a continuation of the lower price momentum in food prices \nin the coming months as well. Fuel inflation has also moderated over the last couple \nof months to touch 2.6 per cent in June. The Core inflation, in contrast, has increased \nto 4.4 per cent in June from 4.1-4.2 per cent during February-May of this calendar \nyear. An increase in gold and precious metal prices is a significant factor behind the \nuptick in Core inflation. \n34. \nThe inflation outlook in terms of average CPI inflation, for the fiscal year (FY) \n2025-26, has become very benign, mainly on account of unexpectedly low food \ninflation. The RBI has lowered its CPI inflation forecast to 3.1%. However, the \naverage core inflation is likely to remain above the target range during coming \nquarters. \n \n \n \n7 \n \nGDP Growth  \n35. \nOverall, the GDP growth is holding up so far amidst mixed signals coming \nthrough some high-frequency indicators. The rural consumption, including tractor and \ntwo-wheeler sales, remained resilient in Q1: 2025-26, whereas indicators of urban \nconsumption, including FMCGs, passenger vehicle sales and also air passenger \ngrowth, remained tepid.  \n36. \nGoing forward, several factors are expected to provide comfort: an increase in \nthe flow of funds to the private sector through bond markets and non-banking \nchannels, a super-healthy corporate balance sheet, high levels of PMIs for the \nmanufacturing and services sectors, and rising capacity utilisation. The above-normal \nmonsoon, low inflation, supportive monetary, regulatory, and fiscal policies, along \nwith the onset of the festival season, are expected to support growth by boosting \ndemand. The sustained growth rates in construction, trade and a broad range of \nservices sectors are expected to remain buoyant in the coming months, supporting \nthe growth. \n37. \nThere are also some stress signs associated with achieving a 6.5% growth \nrate. Private capex growth remains below expectations, though the recent signals in \nthis regard are encouraging. Overall, fixed investment is primarily supported by \ngovernment capex. Growth in the industrial sector remained subdued and uneven \nacross segments. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) has also shown \nmoderation. The net FDI is also trending at low levels. \n38. \nMoreover, prospects on the exports front are highly uncertain amidst ever-\nchanging tariff announcements and protracted trade negotiations. The headwinds \nemanating from a fluid geopolitical scenario, heightened global uncertainties, and \nvolatility in international financial markets pose serious risks to the domestic growth \noutlook. US tariffs have already put Indian exporters at a disadvantage. Signs of \ndistress in growth and employment for MSMEs are visible in sectors reliant upon the \nUS market, such as diamond and jewellery, textile and apparel, and fisheries. \n39. \nUnder normal circumstances, there would be a case for a growth-supportive \ninterest rate cut given benign inflation prospects. However, the unusually high degree \nof uncertainty on both inflation and growth fronts calls for greater caution. The CPI \ninflation is projected to cross 4 per cent in Q4:2025-26 and remain above the point \ntarget in subsequent quarters due to unfavourable base effects. Moreover, the impact \nof the demand boost from the monetary and fiscal policy in action is yet to play out. \nThere is a risk of imported inflation due to uncertainty about the prices of some \ncommodities and the unquantifiable implications of volatility in global financial \nmarkets. \n40. \nOn the other hand, improved domestic food supply chain logistics, healthy \nkharif sowing, and above-normal water reservoirs bode well for food inflation in the \ncoming quarters. The expected revision in the inflation series based on the revised \nCPI index (with a lower weightage for food) adds to the downside of inflation risks. In \nthe future, the base effect (high prices of precious metals) can also moderate the \ncore inflation. \n41. \nAll these factors have increased the variance of the inflation forecast. The \nassumptions about global growth and inflation are changing by the day. Global \ngrowth is holding up so far. Exports have been front-loaded, with exporters absorbing \na larger share of the tariff costs. This means that the full impact of tariff tussles is yet \nto play out fully on the US economy and the rest of the world. In the second half of \nthe fiscal year, global growth and inflation can turn out to be very different from the \nprojected levels.  \n8 \n \n42. \nThe tariff tussle between the two largest economies will simultaneously \nunleash inflationary and deflationary pressures on the Indian economy. The overall \neffect is hard to quantify. Given the high degree of uncertainty regarding growth and \nthe volatile nature of food inflation, caution is warranted in the rate cut. The interest \nrate decisions of the US Fed and other central banks in the coming months will also \nhave a bearing on the feasibility of a further rate cut by the RBI and its quantum.  \n43. \nTo respond to an unpredictable set of events, it is crucial to maintain policy \noptions, in terms of the number of policy tools that can be used as well as their force. \nOnly the incoming data can help in assessing the inflation with the precision required \nunder the current global economic order. Moreover, the MPC needs to watch the \npass-through of the 100 bps rate cut to ascertain its effects on inflation and growth. \nWe need to monitor the sectoral impacts of direct and indirect effects of tariffs on \nIndian exports. \n44. \nIn view of the above-discussed multi-dimensional and high-order uncertainty, I \nvote to pause the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) at 5.50 \nper cent.  \n45. \nFor the same reason, I support keeping the monetary policy stance as \n\u2018neutral\u2019.  \n \nStatement by Dr. Rajiv Ranjan \n46. \nThe August MPC meeting was my 21st meeting as MPC member. This was \none of the most difficult meetings in terms of deciding on the future course of \nmonetary policy. Even though I had said in my June 2025 meeting minutes, \n\u201c\u2026having front-loaded the policy rate cut by 50 bps, we would be left with less room \nfor further downward adjustments in policy rates\u201d, I felt that the arguments were \nequally strong and delicately poised on both sides in this August meeting \u2013 to cut the \npolicy repo rate by 25 bps or not to cut. Let me first summarise the arguments in \nfavour of cutting the policy rate by 25 bps. \n47. \nWe have reduced the projection of inflation substantially by 60 basis points to \n3.1 per cent in the current policy as the inflation outlook for the remainder of 2025-26 \nhas turned benign, supported by favourable base effects, a well-progressing \nsouthwest monsoon, healthy kharif sowing, and comfortable foodgrain stocks. With \nprojections for 2025-26 marked down significantly, inflation well below the 4 per cent \ntarget in the near term and greater traction of cyclical policy support for economic \nactivity as the festive season approaches, there is a good case to be made that the \nroom has opened up again for policy to ease further in support of growth, especially \nin an uncertain global environment.  \n48. \nOn the other hand, the arguments to maintain the status quo with respect to \nthe policy rate and stance seemed to be stronger on account of the following. First, \nthe recent monetary easing cycle has already delivered a front-loaded 100 bps rate \ncut since February 2025. Its effects are still working through the system, and \ntransmission to credit markets is ongoing. Thus, it is prudent at the current juncture to \nadopt a wait-and-watch approach to see the extent of transmission before delivering \nfurther policy stimulus. The impact of the CRR cut done earlier will also start kicking \nin from September 2025.  \n49. \nSecond, the growth outlook for the Indian economy for 2025-26 has been \nevolving on the lines projected in the previous policy, despite unfavourable global \ndemand conditions. The monsoon season has been progressing well with higher \nkharif sowing. Performance of the non-financial corporate sector is holding well. Key \nhigh-frequency volume-based activity indicators show that economic activity is \n9 \n \nholding firm. As such, growth is tracking our earlier projections, robust but still below \naspirations.  \n50. \nThird, the decline in headline inflation has been largely due to sharp correction \nin its volatile component i.e., the food prices. Core inflation remains around 4 per \ncent, with potential upside risks from demand revival. Adverse weather shocks could \nupend the current sanguine food price scenario. The baseline inflation projections \nindicate that headline inflation is likely to overshoot the 4 per cent target by Q4:2025-\n26 and further increase to 4.9 per cent by Q1:2026-27. Given these risks, there is a \nstrong case for monetary policy to wait for a more definitive signal about a sustained \nmoderation in inflation before venturing into further policy easing.  \n51. \nFourth, globally, countries are moving cautiously with either pausing or cutting \nrates intermittently. We have had a rather accelerated easing in the last three \nconsecutive policies.  \n52. \nOverall, growth remains resilient, supported by public capex, resilient rural \ndemand, and steady services activity, although industry shows some unevenness. \nInflation is significantly lower than projected earlier, but the decline is concentrated in \na few volatile components and the outlook suggests a rise in inflation to above the \ntarget going forward. In next few months, we can have clarity on how tariffs and their \nimpact on the macroeconomy evolve. The prudent course of action is to allow time \nfor the recent policy easing to transmit fully into the economy and to assess its effects \non real economic activity. An additional rate cut at the current juncture could also \nreduce our policy space should global or domestic risks materialise. After weighing \nthese considerations, I conclude that the balance of risks calls for no action in this \nmeeting, and accordingly I vote for the policy repo rate to be kept unchanged at 5.50 \nper cent.  \n53. \nI also feel that the neutral stance of policy should be maintained, as it allows \nenough flexibility to react to the unfolding growth-inflation dynamics. Policy will have \nto be data-dependent, forward-looking and nimble-footed, aiming to secure price \nstability while supporting growth. Such an approach leaves the space to act, should \ndownside risks to growth arises and inflation remains on the projected trajectory.  \n \nStatement by Dr. Poonam Gupta  \n54. \nIn this meeting, I vote for the status quo, i.e., to keep the policy repo rate \nunchanged at 5.5 percent. My vote is predicated on the following three factors.  \n55. \nFirst, the evolving growth-inflation dynamics have weighed on my vote. \nDespite receding from their peak of May and June, financial market volatility and \ngeopolitical uncertainties have remained elevated; and some trade uncertainties have \naggravated for India. Notwithstanding these challenges, the Indian economy remains \nresilient overall. A favourable monsoon, low inflation, government infrastructure \nspending and congenial financial conditions facilitated by frontloaded policy easing \nremains supportive of domestic economic activity.  \n56. \nSince the last policy, the inflation outcome has turned out to be surprisingly \nbenign with CPI headline inflation declining to 2.1 per cent (y-o-y) in June. One could \nargue that the benign inflation outlook gives the headroom to continue with policy \neasing in support of accelerating the growth momentum. However, this moderation is \nnot general, but is primarily driven by a deflation in food (-0.2 per cent y-o-y), \nparticularly by a sharp decline in the prices of vegetables and pulses. Besides, CPI \ninflation is likely to firm up above 4 per cent from Q4:2025-26 as the unfavourable \nbase effects would come into play and move closer to 5 per cent in Q1:2026-27 even \nwith moderate price momentum. Additionally, core inflation is likely to remain above 4 \n10 \n \nper cent in the near to medium term, barring any major negative shock to input \nprices.  \n57. \nSecond, this policy action needs to be seen in its totality and in the context of \nthe past actions. There has been a cumulative rate cut of 100 bps since February \n2025, which includes a frontloaded rate cut of 50 bps in the June policy. \nSimultaneously, the RBI has deployed other tools during this period, including easier \nliquidity conditions; regulatory easing; and transparent, and frequent communication \nand forward guidance. The effect of all these actions has been permeating through \nthe economy. Transmission of the cumulative rate cut has been impressively rapid, \nbut it is still unfolding, and is likely to pick up in the coming months, facilitated by the \nCRR cuts coming into effect from September 2025.  \n58. \nThird, while awaiting the transmission to be completed, the cost or availability \nof funds (bank credit and other sources of funds) is not deemed to be a material \nconstraint to growth at the current juncture. Rather, heightened global uncertainties \nand structural factors seem to be more constraining for new investment and \nconsumption decisions. \n59. \nTaking into account the growth-inflation outlook, past actions, the state of the \ndomestic economy, and the global dynamics, I do not see the scope or rationale for a \nfurther policy rate cut at this point. I also propose a neutral stance so that the future \nactions could be data dependent, i.e., conditioned by the relative dynamics of growth \nand inflation, while also internalizing the impact of policy actions from other relevant \ncountries.  \n \nStatement by Shri Sanjay Malhotra \n60. \nThe global economy continues to traverse a period of heightened uncertainty \non account of trade and tariff negotiations and lingering geopolitical tensions. Global \ngrowth outlook, however, has improved at the margin for 2025 driven by front loading \nof exports in anticipation of tariffs, easing of financial conditions and fiscal expansion \nin advanced economies (AEs). The pace of disinflation, however, has slowed down \nand inflation continues to remain above the target in most AEs. \n61. \nDomestic growth has evolved largely in line with the assessment set out in our \nJune policy. Growth projected at 6.5 per cent is resilient, considering the current \nuncertain environment which shows no signs of abatement. However, this is certainly \nlower than what we can achieve. High-frequency indicators point toward buoyant \nrural economic activity and consumption, whereas urban spending continues to \nremain sluggish. During the remaining part of the financial year, growth is likely to \nreceive support from both favourable supply-side factors as well as a supportive \npolicy environment. Monsoon has progressed well, sowing has been satisfactory, and \nreservoir levels are comfortable, all of which augur well for farm output and rural \ndemand. Urban demand is likely to pick up during the festive season, especially in a \nperiod of benign inflation. Services sector activity is also likely to remain strong, as \nevident from forward-looking assessments from surveys. Uncertainty in external \ndemand, driven by tariff and geopolitical uncertainty, remains the major drag on \ngrowth as it also hinders private investment intentions, which is yet to show visible \nsigns of improvement. \n62. \nInflation continued its downward trajectory, with the headline CPI inflation in \nJune at 2.1 per cent - a 77-month low. The decline in inflation was primarily driven by \nthe food component, which registered a year-on-year contraction of -0.2 per cent in \nJune. The extent of moderation in food inflation turned out to be larger than that \nexpected during the June MPC meeting, as supply-side conditions turned out to be \nmuch more favourable. Core (CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation recorded a \n11 \n \nmodest rise to reach 4.4 per cent in June, driven by higher gold prices. Headline \ninflation, driven by the food component, is likely to record substantially lower numbers \nin the near term. The baseline forecast for CPI inflation during 2025-26 is being \nrevised downwards to 3.1 per cent. \n63. \nOverall, our economy presents a picture of strength, stability, and opportunity. \nIndia\u2019s strong fundamentals, growth inducing policies, and forward-looking economic \nstrategy clearly place it in a strong position. While growth has remained steady, \ninflation outcomes have been far more benign on account of higher food price \nmoderation. Although we are likely to see inflation undershooting the target in the \nnear term, with a likelihood of monthly numbers even crossing the lower tolerance \nband of 2 per cent, headline inflation is projected to inch up from Q3 onwards. The \nuncertainties of tariffs are still evolving. Monetary policy transmission of the \ncumulative 100 basis points cut in the policy rate since February 2025, though \nhastened due to various measures, is still continuing. The CRR cut, that is likely to \nkick in from next month, will also facilitate further monetary transmission and \nstimulate economic activity.  \n64. \nConsidering all these, especially the current state of uncertainty on the \nexternal front, monetary policy needs to remain watchful. Therefore, I vote to keep \nthe policy repo rate unchanged at 5.50 per cent. I also support retaining the neutral \nstance as it would provide monetary policy the necessary flexibility to respond to the \nevolving domestic and global economic conditions.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         (Puneet Pancholy)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/940                                         Chief General Manager \n",

The information on face value and market value of \nunits held by non-residents, unit premium reserve, other foreign liabilities and assets \nof MFs as at end of the financial year were collected under the survey. The external \nassets and liabilities of their AMCs were taken from the annual census on foreign \nliabilities and assets (FLA) of direct investment companies for the reference period \n2024-25. \n \nHighlights: \n \nI. Mutual Funds (MFs): \n\u2022 Foreign liabilities of MFs increased by 19.9 per cent during 2024-25 to                      \nUS$ 30.5 billion (at market value) in March 2025, due to the rise in units \nissued to non-residents (Table 1). \n\u2022 Overseas assets of MFs declined by 5.6 per cent and stood at US$ 8.3 \nbillion in March 2025, due to lower holdings of foreign equity securities.  \n\u2022 As a result, the net foreign liabilities of MFs increased to US$ 22.2 billion in \nMarch 2025 from US$ 16.6 billion a year ago.  \n\u2022 Non-residents of United Arab Emirates (UAE), the United States of \nAmerica (USA), the United Kingdom (UK) and Singapore held the largest \nshare in MF units, both in terms of face value as well as at market value \n(Tables 2 and 3).  \n\u2022 Over 95 per cent of the overseas equity investment of the MFs were \nconcentrated in the USA, Luxembourg, and Ireland (Table 4). \n \nII. Asset Management Companies (AMCs): \n\u2022 Foreign liabilities of AMCs increased by 16.8 per cent and stood at                      \nUS$ 7.5 billion in March 2025, on the back of higher inward direct \ninvestments (Table 5). \n\u2022 Residents in Japan, Canada and the UK together accounted for over 83 \nper cent of FDI among Indian AMCs (Table 6). \n\u2022 The overseas assets of AMCs increased marginally from their previous \nyear\u2019s level and were largely held in Guernsey, Singapore and Mauritius \n(Table 7).  \n \n \n                 (Puneet Pancholy)  \nPress Release: 2025-2026/926                                                 Chief General Manager \n \n1 The results of the previous survey round for the year 2023-24 were released vide press release dated August 13, 2024. \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n \n \nTable 1: Mutual Funds \u2013 Foreign Liabilities and Assets \n \nItem \nEnd-March 2024 (R) \nEnd-March 2025 (P) \n\u20b9 crore \nUS$ \nmillion \n\u20b9 crore \nUS$ \nmillion \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \nForeign Liabilities \n2,12,120 \n25,442 \n2,61,057 \n30,504 \n      (a) Market Value of Units \n2,11,747 \n25,397 \n2,60,546 \n30,444 \n      (b) Other Foreign Liabilities \n373 \n45 \n511 \n60 \nForeign Assets \n73,518 \n8,818 \n71,265 \n8,328 \n     (a) Equity Securities \n71,095 \n8,527 \n69,086 \n8,073 \n     (b) Debt Securities \n- \n- \n- \n- \n     (c) Other Foreign Assets \n2,423 \n291 \n2,179 \n255 \nNet Liabilities \n1,38,602 \n16,624 \n1,89,792 \n22,176 \n  \nForeign Liabilities in Units at Face Value \n49,777 \n5,970 \n63,112 \n7,374 \nNotes: \n1.

Products of the entities which completed the \u2018Test Phase\u2019 were evaluated based on \nmutually agreed test scenarios and expected outcomes. Accordingly, one product \noutlined below has been found viable within the boundary conditions defined during \ntesting under RS: \n \nSl. No. \nSandbox Entity \nDescription \n1 \nIndian \nBanks\u2019 \nDigital \nInfrastructure \nCompany \n(IBDIC) Private Limited \nPartner \nFinancial \nInstitutions - ICICI Bank, \nHDFC Bank, Yes Bank and \nAditya Birla Capital Limited \n(formerly known as Aditya \nBirla Finance Limited).    \n \nThe blockchain based deep-tier financing \nsolution enables MSMEs, which are part of the \nsupply chain of a creditworthy anchor, to get \naccess to affordable finance linked to their \nvalue addition. The Tier-1 supplier invoice \naccepted by the anchor is tokenised and the \nplatform facilitates the transfer of these tokens \nby the buyer to the seller in lieu of payment for \nthe accepted invoice.

After considering the bank's reply to the notice and oral \nsubmissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the following \ncharges against the bank were sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: \n \nThe bank had: \n \ni. \nmade donations to trusts in excess of prescribed regulatory ceiling; \nii. \nfailed to present the true and fair picture of its profits and assets in profit and \nloss statement and balance sheet respectively; \niii. \nconducted concurrent audit monthly instead of conducting simultaneous check \nof the transactions and reports were submitted with delays;  \niv. \nfailed to categorise certain Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) in the appropriate \nNPA sub-category; and \nv. \nfailed to carry out periodic review of risk categorisation of accounts with such \nperiodicity being at least once in six months. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to \npronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank with \nits customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without prejudice to any other \naction that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n                     (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/913                                                     Chief General Manager \n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u093f\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

    "file_extracted_text": " \nAugust 14, 2025 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on Maharashtra Gramin Bank, Aurangabad \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated August 12, 2025, \nimposed a monetary penalty of \u20b94.20 lakh (Rupees Four Lakh Twenty Thousand \nonly) on Maharashtra Gramin Bank, Aurangabad (the bank) for non-compliance with \ncertain directions issued by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development \n(NABARD) on \u2018Offsite Surveillance System \u2013 Revision of Due dates for Submission \nof OSS/FMS Returns\u2019 and certain directions issued by RBI on \u2018Know Your Customer \n(KYC)\u2019. This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under \nthe provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read with Sections 46(4)(i) and 51(1) of the \nBanking Regulation Act. \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by NABARD with reference to \nits financial position as on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with NABARD and RBI directions and related correspondence in that \nregard, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty \nshould not be imposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After \nconsidering the bank\u2019s reply to the notice and oral submissions made during the \npersonal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charges against the bank \nwere sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: \nThe bank had: \ni) \nreported certain frauds to NABARD with delay; and  \nii) \nfailed to put in place a system of periodic review of risk categorisation of \naccounts, with such periodicity being at least once in six months. \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers. Further, imposition of monetary penalty is without prejudice \nto any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n              (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/910                                               Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
