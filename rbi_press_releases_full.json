It was a \ncombined impact of decrease in foreign-owned assets in India (US$ 29.8 billion) \nand increase in Indian residents\u2019 overseas financial assets (US$ 8.6 billion) \nduring the quarter (Table 1). \n \n\u2022 Accordingly, the ratio of India\u2019s international assets to international liabilities \nimproved to 81.3 per cent as at end-September 2025 from 79.1 per cent a \nquarter ago. The ratio has consistently improved from 71.4 per cent two years \nago and 76.1 per cent a year ago (Chart 1 & Table 1). \n \n\u2022 The decline of all major components of foreign-owned assets in India viz., inward \nportfolio investment (US$ 13.9 billion), direct investment (US$ 8.9 billion) and \nother investment (US$ 7.0 billion) contributed to the overall decline of foreign-\nowned assets in India. \n \n\u2022 Indian residents\u2019 overseas financial assets increased during the quarter, mainly \non the back of higher outward direct investments. \n \n\u2022 Reserve assets stood at US$ 700.1 billion as at end-September 2025 and \naccounted for 58.8 per cent of overseas financial assets of Indian residents \n(Table 2).  \n \n\u2022 The share of debt liabilities in total external liabilities increased marginally to 55.0 \nper cent as at end-September 2025 from 54.3 per cent a quarter ago (Table 3). \n \n \n \n \n \n                    (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1810                                             Chief General Manager \n \n[1] India\u2019s quarterly IIP is disseminated with a lag of one quarter and the previous quarterly IIP for end-June 2025 was \nreleased in the RBI website on September 30, 2025. \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \nTable 1:  Overall International Investment Position of India \n(US$ billion) \nPeriod \nPosition as at end of \nSep-24   \n(PR) \nDec-24 \n(PR) \nMar-25 \n(PR) \nJun-25   \n(PR) \nSep-25 \n(P) \nNet IIP (A-B) \n-353.4 \n-364.0 \n-329.1 \n-312.7 \n-274.3 \nA.

However, downside risks persist due to still \nelevated uncertainty, high public debt, and the risk of a disorderly market correction. \n\u2022 Global financial markets appear strong on the surface but show growing underlying \nvulnerabilities. Sharp rise in equities and other risk assets, the expanding role of \nnon-bank financial intermediaries and their deepening interconnectedness with \nbanks, and the growth of stablecoins all heighten global financial system fragilities. \n\u2022 Despite an uncertain and challenging global economic backdrop, the Indian \neconomy continues to grow strongly, underpinned by robust domestic demand, \nbenign inflation, and prudent macroeconomic policies. \n\u2022 The domestic financial system remains robust and resilient, bolstered by strong \nbalance sheets, easy financial conditions, and low financial market volatility. \nNonetheless, there are near-term risks from external uncertainties - geopolitical and \ntrade related.  \n\u2022 The health of the scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) remains sound with strong \ncapital and liquidity buffers, improved asset quality and robust profitability. \n\u2022 Macro stress test results affirm the resilience of SCBs to withstand losses under \nhypothetical adverse scenarios and maintain capital buffers well above the \nregulatory minimum. Stress tests also confirm the resilience of mutual funds and \nclearing corporations. \n\u2022 Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) remain robust supported by strong capital \nbuffers, solid earnings, and improving asset quality. \n\u2022 The insurance sector continues to display balance sheet resilience and the \nconsolidated solvency ratio remained above the minimum threshold limit. \n \n \n                                (Brij Raj)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1807                                                       Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

    "file_extracted_text": " \nDecember 29, 2025 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on The Salem Urban Co-operative Bank Limited, \nTamil Nadu \n \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated December 26, 2025, \nimposed a monetary penalty of \u20b950,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) on The \nSalem Urban Co-operative Bank Limited, Tamil Nadu (the bank) for non-compliance \nwith certain directions issued by RBI on \u2018Framework for Compromise Settlements \nand Technical Write-offs\u2019. This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers \nconferred on RBI under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read with Sections \n46(4)(i) and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by RBI with reference to its \nfinancial position as on March 31, 2025. Based on supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice \nwas issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be \nimposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the \nbank\u2019s reply to the notice and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, \nRBI found, inter alia, that the following charge against the bank was sustained, \nwarranting imposition of monetary penalty: \n \n     The bank had sanctioned non-agricultural loans to members, who had previously \navailed compromise settlements, without adhering to the prescribed minimum cooling \nperiod. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1789                                         Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

This Report presents the performance of the banking sector, \nincluding commercial banks, co-operative banks and non-banking financial \ninstitutions, during 2024-25 and 2025-26 so far. \n \nHighlights \n \n\u2022 \nThe Indian commercial banking sector remained resilient during 2024-25, \nsupported by double-digit balance sheet expansion. Deposits and credit of \nscheduled commercial banks (SCBs) grew in double digits, albeit with a \nmoderation from the previous year. \n \n\u2022 \nThe capital to risk weighted assets ratio of SCBs was 17.4 per cent at end-\nMarch 2025 and 17.2 per cent at end-September 2025. \n \n\u2022 \nAsset quality strengthened further, with the gross non-performing assets \n(GNPA) ratio declining to a multi-decadal low of 2.2 per cent at end-March \n2025 and 2.1 per cent at end-September 2025. \n \n\u2022 \nProfitability of the SCBs remained robust with the return on assets (RoA) at \n1.4 per cent and return on equity (RoE) at 13.5 per cent in 2024-25. During \nH1: 2025-26, RoA and RoE of the SCBs stood at 1.3 per cent and 12.5 per \ncent, respectively. \n \n\u2022 \n The consolidated balance sheet of urban co-operative banks recorded higher \ngrowth in 2024-25 than that in the previous year. Their asset quality improved \nfor the fourth consecutive year, alongside strengthening of their capital buffers \nand profitability.   \n \n\u2022 \n The non-banking financial companies continued to record double digit credit \ngrowth along with robust capital buffers. Their asset quality also improved \nduring the year.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                   (Brij Raj)  \n \n      Press Release: 2025-2026/1786                                     Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

    "file_extracted_text": "1 \n \n \nDecember 22, 2025 \nRBI Bulletin \u2013 December 2025 \n \n     Today, the Reserve Bank released the December 2025 issue of its monthly Bulletin. \nThe Bulletin includes bi-monthly monetary policy statement (December 2025), four \nspeeches, four articles and current statistics.  \n \n     The four articles are: I. State of the Economy; II. Government Finances 2025-26: A \nHalf-Yearly Review; III. Composite Leading Indicator for GVA - Manufacturing for India; \nIV. Decoding Safe Asset Volatility Amid Geopolitical Risks Using Neural Networks. \n \nI. \nState of the Economy \n \n     Global uncertainty retreated further from its highly elevated levels. Major equity \nmarkets experienced volatile movements due to concerns about stretched market \nvaluations. The Indian economy, supported by resilient domestic demand in Q2:2025-\n26, grew at its fastest pace in the last six quarters. High-frequency indicators for \nNovember suggest that overall economic activity has held up with demand conditions \nremaining robust. Headline CPI inflation edged up but continued to remain below the \nlower tolerance level. Financial conditions remained benign, and the flow of financial \nresources to the commercial sector remained robust. India\u2019s current account deficit \nmoderated in Q2:2025-26 over the same period last year, supported by a lower \nmerchandise trade deficit, robust services exports, and strong remittance receipts. \n \nII. \nGovernment Finances 2025-26: A Half-Yearly Review \n \nBy Amrita Basu, Akash Raj, Harshita Yadav, Debapriya Saha, Aayushi Khandelwal, \nAnoop K Suresh, Shromona Ganguly and Atri Mukherjee \n \n     This article presents a review of Government finances for the first half of 2025-26. \nIt analyses the trends in receipt and expenditure as well as gross fiscal deficit and its \nfinancing by the Centre and States. Estimates on general government (Centre plus \nStates) finances for Q1 and Q2 of 2025-26 are also presented. \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 The receipts for the Centre during H1:2025-26 were broadly in line with their budget \nestimates. The moderation in tax receipts was partially offset by robust non-tax \nrevenue as well as non-debt capital receipts. On the expenditure front, the Centre \nhad contained its revenue expenditure while the growth in capital expenditure \nturned out to be consistently robust. \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n\u2022 The growth in States\u2019 revenue receipts during H1:2025-26 was on account of both \ntax and non-tax sources, while there was a contraction in grants from the Centre. \nOn the expenditure front, States sustained the pace of revenue expenditure during \nH1:2025-26, while their capital expenditure recorded improvement.  \n\u2022 Both the Centre and States witnessed improvement in the quality of their \nexpenditure, as reflected in a lower revenue expenditure to capital outlay ratio.  \n \nIII. \nComposite Leading Indicator for GVA - Manufacturing for India \n \nBy Anirban Sanyal, Shivangee Misra and Sanjay Singh \n \n     The manufacturing sector accounts for nearly 17 per cent of India\u2019s gross value \nadded and plays a pivotal role in the country\u2019s growth dynamics. Leading business \ncycle indicators serve as important tools for providing advance signals of turning points \nin economic activity. In this context, the article introduces a composite leading indicator \n(CLI) for the manufacturing sector at a quarterly frequency, designed to anticipate \nshifts in the sector\u2019s business cycle and strengthen short-term economic assessment. \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 The CLI has been developed through a two-stage process based on the growth-\nrate-cycle methodology. \n\u2022 The leading indicator draws on a set of variables capturing domestic demand, \ninflation dynamics, survey-based sentiments, industrial credit flows, uncertainty \nmetrics, and global macroeconomic trends. \n\u2022 The high-frequency indicators, selected through Random Forest and XGBoost \nmodels and aggregated using inverse-standard-deviation weights, exhibit a stable \nleading relationship with the GVA-manufacturing growth-rate cycle. \n\u2022 The turnaround points of the business cycle of the proposed CLI shows a leading \nproperty with the growth rate cycle of GVA manufacturing by one quarter. The \nleading property of the proposed CLI shows robustness in the pre-COVID period \nand post-pandemic recovery period. \n \nIV. \nDecoding Safe Asset Volatility Amid Geopolitical Risks Using Neural \nNetworks \n  \nBy Ankon Ghosh, Bipul Ghosh and Sandhya Kuruganti \n  \n     Safe haven assets such as gold, silver, crude oil, and US Treasuries have long \nserved as anchors of stability during periods of market turbulence. In recent years, \nrising geopolitical tensions have reshaped how these assets respond to uncertainty, \nleading to new patterns in their volatility behaviour. This study explores how major safe \nassets react to geopolitical shocks and examines the effectiveness of neural network \nmodels in forecasting these complex, non-linear dynamics. \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 Crude oil price volatility is the most sensitive to geopolitical disturbances, reflecting \nits dependence on global supply routes and vulnerability to regional conflicts. \n\u2022 Gold continues to demonstrate strong price stability, underscoring its enduring \nreputation as a trusted safe haven in times of financial stress. \n3 \n \n\u2022 Silver and US Treasury securities exhibit moderate responses, balancing industrial \ndemand factors and the traditional investor shift toward safety. \n\u2022 Neural network-based models, particularly those that integrate country-specific \ngeopolitical risk indices, provide more accurate forecasts of asset volatility than \nconventional econometric approaches. \n \n     The views expressed in the Bulletin articles are of the authors and do not represent \nthe views of the Reserve Bank of India. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   (Brij Raj)             \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1750                                             Chief General Manager \n \n \n",
