The market participants can bid in the switch auction through the Switch Transaction \nmodule provided in the e-Kuber portal. \nBidding in a switch transaction \n2. Bidding in the auction implies that the market participants agree to sell the source \nsecurity/ies to the Government of India (GoI) and simultaneously agree to buy the destination \nsecurity from the GoI at their respective quoted prices. \nPlacing of bids \n3. Each bid should specify the following details: \nI. \nAmount of the source security (Face Value) that the participants are willing to sell. \nII. \nPrice of the source security (expressed up to two decimal places). \nIII. \nChoice of destination security and the price of the destination security (expressed up \nto two decimal places), at which the participants are willing to buy the destination \nsecurity. \n4. The participants can choose to bid for any/all the destination security/ies, but the aggregate \namount of bids for the source security should not exceed their holdings of the source security \nin face value terms.   \nMinimum Bid size \n5. Minimum bid size would be \u20b910,000 and in multiples of \u20b910,000 thereafter. The participants \nare allowed to submit multiple bids. However, the aggregate amount of bids submitted should \nnot exceed the notified amount of source security/basket of source securities in the auction.  \nPrice of source security \n6. The price of the source security quoted must be equal to the FBIL closing price of the \nsource security as on the previous working day. \n7. Bids for source security not as per the price mentioned above will be rejected.  \nPrice of destination security \n8. Bids for the destination security may be placed after taking into account the price of source \nsecurity as mentioned above.  \nMethod of auction \n9. The auction will be a multiple-price based auction, i.e. successful bids will get accepted at \ntheir respective quoted prices for the source and destination securities. \nAuction decision \n10. The auction cut-off will be decided based on the price of the destination security/ies. \n11. Successful bidders are those who have placed their bids at or above the cut-off price. All \nbids lower than the cut-off price will be rejected. \n12. There will be provision of pro-rata allotment, should there be more than one successful bid \nat the cut-off price.  \n \nAmount of destination security and dealing in odd amounts during switch auction \n13. The switch ratio, which is the ratio of the price of the source security to the price of the \ndestination security, would be rounded off at 8 decimal places. \n14. The amount of destination security to be issued for each successful bid will be computed \nby multiplying the allotted amount (FV) of the source security with the rounded-off switch ratio. \nThe amount of destination security (FV) would be rounded-off to the nearest lower value in \nmultiples of \u20b910,000.  \n15. The odd amount of destination securities (less than \u20b910,000) which has been rounded-off, \nwould be notionally allotted and bought back from the bidders at the quoted bid price of the \ndestination security. The net cash consideration to be paid to the bidder for such odd amounts \nwould be the clean price of these securities (as the accrued interest received during notional \nallotment and paid during notional buyback offset each other). \nFund settlement \n16. Though the conversion would be broadly cash neutral, there will be fund settlement for the \nnet accrued interest (accrued interest for the source security FV \u2013 accrued interest for the \ndestination security FV) for each bid. Cash consideration (due to rounding-off of face value of \ndestination security) computed for each bid would be added to the net accrued interest.  \nAccordingly, fund settlement will be done for the final amount (Net accrued interest + cash \nconsideration) for each bid. \nNote: An illustration for the calculation of cash consideration due to rounding-off of \ndestination security face value is as given below: \nAmount of Source Security (FV) \n\u20b910,00,00,000.00 \nPrice of Source Security  \n\u20b997.50 \nPrice of Destination Security  \n\u20b999.20 \nSwitch Ratio (rounded-off at 8 decimals) \n0.98286290 \nDestination Security FV before rounding off  \n\u20b99,82,86,290.00 \nDestination Security FV re-issued after rounding-off  \n\u20b99,82,80,000.00 \nOdd amount of rounded-off destination security (FV) \n\u20b96290.00 \nCash consideration due to rounding off (Clean Price \ncalculated at the quoted price of destination security) \n\u20b96240.00 \n17. The settlement of the auction would be held on T+1 basis. \nHelp Desk \n18.

The Master Direction updates the regulatory framework \nfor IRD in line with developments in the IRD market and with a view to support the risk \nmanagement needs of the broader financial system. It also aims at fostering greater \ntransparency in the Rupee IRD market.  \n \n2.

Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n                    (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1658                                         Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

    "file_extracted_text": " \nDecember 05, 2025 \n \nReserve Bank of India imposes monetary penalty on Jammu and Kashmir Bank \nLimited \n \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated December 01, 2025, imposed \na monetary penalty of \u20b999.30 lakh (Rupees Ninety nine lakh thirty thousand only) on \nJammu and Kashmir Bank Limited (the bank) for contravention of the provisions of section \n26A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (BR Act) and non-compliance with certain \ndirections issued by RBI on \u2018Internal Ombudsman Scheme 2018\u2019, \u2018Customer Service in \nBanks\u2019, and \u2018Know Your Customer (KYC) Directions\u2019. This penalty has been imposed in \nexercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section 47 A(1)(c) read with \nSection 46(4)(i) of the BR Act. \n \n     The Statutory Inspection for Supervisory Evaluation of the bank was conducted by RBI \nwith reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory \nfindings of non-compliance with the provisions of BR Act, RBI directions and related \ncorrespondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause \nas to why penalty should not be imposed on it for contravention of the provisions of BR \nAct and non-compliance with the said RBI directions.  \n \n     After considering the bank\u2019s reply to the notice, additional submissions made by it and \noral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found that the following charges \nagainst the bank were sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty:  \n \ni. \nThe bank did not escalate certain complaints that were partly / wholly rejected by \nits internal grievance mechanism to the Internal Ombudsman for a final decision;  \nii. \nThe bank did not send final letters to its customers regarding redressal of their \ncomplaints and thereby failed to ensure that customers were made aware of their \nrights to approach Banking Ombudsman in case they were not satisfied with the \nbank\u2019s response;  \niii. \nThe bank did not transfer eligible amount in certain accounts to Depositor \nEducation and Awareness (DEA) Fund within the stipulated period; and \niv. \nThe bank did not have a face matching technology in Video-based Customer \nIdentification Process (V-CIP) and also failed to confirm the economic and financial \nprofile/information submitted by the customer during the V-CIP.  \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in statutory and regulatory compliance and is not \nintended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by \nthe bank with its customers. Further, imposition of monetary penalty is without prejudice \nto any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n                             \n                         (Brij Raj)        \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1648                                                  Chief General Manager \n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u093f\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

    "file_extracted_text": " \n \nDecember 05, 2025 \nGovernor\u2019s Statement: December 05, 2025 \n     Good morning and Namaskar. We are in the last month of an eventful and a \nchallenging 2025. We look back at the year so far with satisfaction. The economy \nwitnessed robust growth and benign inflation; the banking system further consolidated \nand the regulatory framework was refined to strengthen the financial system, enhance \nease of doing business, and improve consumer protection. At the same time, we \napproach the new year with hope, vigour and determination to further support the \neconomy and accelerate progress. \n2. \nSince the October policy, the Indian economy has witnessed rapid disinflation, \nwith inflation coming down to an unprecedentedly low level. For the first time since the \nadoption of flexible inflation targeting (FIT), average headline inflation for a quarter at \n1.7 per cent in Q2:2025-26, breached the lower tolerance threshold (2 per cent) of the \ninflation target (4 per cent). It dipped further to a mere 0.3 per cent in October 2025. \nOn the other hand, real GDP growth accelerated to 8.2 per cent in Q2, buoyed by \nstrong spending during the festive season which was further facilitated by the \nrationalisation of the goods and services tax (GST) rates. Inflation at a benign 2.2 per \ncent and growth at 8.0 per cent in H1:2025-26 present a rare goldilocks period.    \n3. \nContrary to earlier expectations, global growth has been relatively strong. \nEvolving geopolitical and trade environments, however, continue to weigh on the \noutlook. Inflation paths remain divergent with headline inflation remaining above target \nin most advanced economies, while pressures in most emerging markets are \ncontained, providing room for accommodative monetary policy. Conflicting pulls and \npressures from AI-fuelled optimism and concerns over high valuations are playing out \nin global equity markets, while divergence in the monetary policy trajectory of central \nbanks is adding to the uncertainty on capital flows and yield spreads. \nMajor Decisions of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and the RBI \n4. \nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 3rd, 4th and 5th of December \nto deliberate and decide on the policy repo rate. After a detailed assessment of the \nevolving macroeconomic conditions and the outlook, the MPC voted unanimously to \nreduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 5.25 per cent with immediate \neffect. Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate under the liquidity \nadjustment facility (LAF) shall stand adjusted to 5.00 per cent and the marginal \nstanding facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 5.50 per cent. The MPC also decided \nto continue with the neutral stance. \n5. \nMoreover, in view of the evolving liquidity conditions and the outlook, the \nReserve Bank has decided to conduct OMO purchases of government securities of \n\u20b91,00,000 crore and a 3-year USD/INR Buy Sell swap of USD 5 billion this month to \ninject durable liquidity into the system.  \n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u01d0\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u036a\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0223\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0223\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u0367\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n6. \nI shall now briefly set out the rationale for the decisions of the MPC. \n7. \nThe MPC noted that headline inflation has eased significantly and is likely to be \nsofter than the earlier projections, primarily on account of the exceptionally benign \nfood prices. Reflecting these favourable conditions, the projections for average \nheadline inflation in 2025-26 and Q1:2026-27 have been further revised downwards. \nCore inflation, which had been rising steadily since Q1:2024-25, eased at the margin \nin Q2:2025-26 and is expected to remain anchored in the period ahead. Both headline \nand core inflation are expected to be at or below the 4 per cent target during the first \nhalf of 2026-27. The underlying inflation pressures are even lower as the impact of \nincrease in price of precious metals is about 50 basis points (bps). Growth, while \nremaining resilient, is expected to soften somewhat.  \n8. \nThus, the growth-inflation balance, especially the benign inflation outlook on \nboth headline and core, continues to provide the policy space to support the growth \nmomentum. Accordingly, the MPC unanimously voted to reduce the policy repo rate by \n25 bps to 5.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the neutral stance.  \nAssessment of Growth and Inflation  \nGrowth \n9. \nReal gross domestic product (GDP) registered a six-quarter high growth of 8.2 \nper cent in Q2:2025-26, underpinned by resilient domestic demand amidst global trade \nand policy uncertainties.1 On the supply side, real gross value added (GVA) expanded \nby 8.1 per cent, aided by buoyant industrial and services sectors. Economic activity \nduring the first half of the financial year benefited from income tax and goods and \nservices tax (GST) rationalisation, softer crude oil prices, front-loading of government \ncapital expenditure, and facilitative monetary and financial conditions supported by \nbenign inflation.  \n10. \nHigh-frequency indicators suggest that domestic economic activity is holding up \nin Q3, although there are some emerging signs of weakness in few leading indicators.2 \nGST rationalisation and festival-related spending supported domestic demand during \nOctober-November. Rural demand3 continues to be robust while urban demand is \nrecovering steadily.4 Investment activity remains healthy5 with private investment \ngaining steam6 on the back of expansion in non-food bank credit,7 and high capacity \n \n1 Private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) expanded by 7.9 per cent during Q2:2025-26 as against \n7.0 per cent in Q1:2025-26. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) also remained resilient at 7.3 per cent \nin Q2:2025-26. \n2 PMI Manufacturing has moderated to a 9-month low of 56.6 in November 2025. Growth in index of \nindustrial production (IIP) moderated to 0.4 per cent in October 2025 from 4.6 per cent in September \n2025. Construction indicators viz., steel consumption and cement production recorded modest growth of \n2.4 per cent and 5.3 per cent, respectively, during October. Electricity demand remained in \ncontractionary zone in November 2025. \n3 Retail two-wheeler sales expanded by 51.8 per cent in October 2025. The demand under Mahatma \nGandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) declined by 33.4 per cent in October-\nNovember, reflecting improvement in farm sector employment. \n4 Retail passenger vehicle sales increased by 11.3 per cent (y-o-y) in October on the back of festive \ndemand and GST cuts. Domestic air passenger traffic witnessed a growth of 5.2 per cent in October-\nNovember.  \n5 Imports of capital goods expanded by 8.7 per cent during October. \n6 Growth in fixed assets of private manufacturing companies has accelerated to 9.0 per cent during \nH1:2025-26 based on half-yearly balance sheet of listed companies. \n3 \n \nutilisation8. Merchandise exports declined sharply in October amid subdued external \ndemand, accompanied by softer services exports.9 On the supply side, agricultural \ngrowth is supported by healthy kharif crop production,10 higher reservoir levels11 and \nbetter rabi crop sowing.12 Manufacturing activity continues to improve, while the \nservices sector is maintaining a steady pace.13  \n11. \nLooking ahead, domestic factors such as healthy agricultural prospects, \ncontinued impact of GST rationalisation, benign inflation, healthy balance sheets of \ncorporates and financial institutions and congenial monetary and financial conditions \nshould continue to support economic activity. Continuing reform initiatives would \nfurther facilitate growth. On the external front, services exports are likely to remain \nstrong, while merchandise exports face some headwinds. External uncertainties \ncontinue to pose downside risks to the outlook, while speedy conclusion of various \nongoing trade and investment negotiations present upside potential. Taking all these \nfactors into consideration, real GDP growth for 2025-26 is projected at 7.3 per cent, \nwith Q3 at 7.0 per cent; and Q4 at 6.5 per cent. Real GDP growth for Q1:2026-27 is \nprojected at 6.7 per cent and Q2 at 6.8 per cent. The risks are evenly balanced. \nInflation \n12. \nHeadline CPI inflation declined to an all time low in October 2025.14 The faster \nthan anticipated decline in inflation was led by correction in food prices15, contrary to \nthe usual trend witnessed during the months of September-October. Core inflation \n(CPI headline excluding food and fuel) remained largely contained in September-\nOctober, despite continued price pressures exerted by precious metals.16 Excluding \n \n7 Bank credit to food processing, textiles, chemicals, base metals, and engineering goods increased y-o-\ny by 10.2 per cent, 9.1 per cent, 12.2 per cent, 13.1 per cent, and 25.1 per cent, respectively, in October \n2025.     \n8 As per the early results, seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation (CU) of manufacturing sector at 74.8 \nper cent in Q2:2025-26 is well above the long-term average.  \n9 India's merchandise exports contracted by 11.9 per cent (y-o-y) to US$ 34.4 billion, while imports rose \nsharply by 16.6 per cent to US$ 76.0 billion in October 2025. Services exports grew by 12.5 per cent \nand services imports expanded by 7.8 per cent in September but moderated sharply to 2.2 per cent and \n2.9 per cent, respectively, in October. \n10 The production of kharif food grains in 2025-26, as per the first advance estimates (FAE), is estimated \nat 2.3 per cent higher than the final estimates of 2024-25. \n11 All-India water storage in 155 major reservoirs stands at 87.8 per cent of the total capacity as of \nNovember 27, 2025, as against 81.9 per cent a year ago and decadal average of 72.3 per cent. \n12 As on 28th November, rabi crop sowing is higher by 9.9 per cent when compared to the same period \nlast year.  \n13 GST revenues rose by 4.6 per cent and 0.7 per cent, respectively, in October and November 2025 \ndespite rate rationalisation. Port cargo traffic increased by 12.0 per cent in October while toll collections \nregistered an expansion of 2.9 per cent in November. Aggregate bank credit and deposits registered \nrobust growth of 11.4 per cent and 10.2 per cent, respectively, as on November 14, 2025. \n14 Based on the current CPI series (Base: 2012 = 100). \n15 Food group registered a deflation of (-) 3.7 per cent on a y-o-y basis after registering (-)1.4 per cent \ndeflation in September. Within food group, vegetables, cereals and spices recorded a deflation of (-) \n27.6 per cent, (-) 16.2 per cent and (-) 3.3 per cent, respectively.  \n \n16 Core inflation moved within a narrow range of 4.3-4.4 per cent during September-October.  \n \n4 \n \ngold, core inflation moderated to 2.6 per cent in October. Overall, the decline in \ninflation has become more generalised.17  \n13. \nTurning to the inflation outlook, food supply prospects have improved on the \nback of higher kharif production, healthy rabi sowing, adequate reservoir levels and \nconducive soil moisture. Barring some metals, international commodity prices are \nlikely to moderate going forward.18 Overall, inflation is likely to be softer than what was \nprojected in October, mainly on account of the fall in food prices. Considering all these \nfactors, CPI inflation for 2025-26 is now projected at 2.0 per cent with Q3 at 0.6 per \ncent; and Q4 at 2.9 per cent. CPI inflation for Q1:2026-27 and Q2 are projected at 3.9 \nper cent and 4.0 per cent, respectively. The underlying inflation pressures are even \nlower as the impact of increase in price of precious metals is about 50 bps. The risks \nare evenly balanced. \nExternal Sector \n14. \nIndia\u2019s current account deficit moderated from 2.2 per cent of GDP in Q2:2024-\n25 to 1.3 per cent in Q2:2025-26 on account of robust services exports19 and strong \nremittances.20 In October 2025, merchandise exports contracted year-on-year, \nwhereas merchandise imports continued to increase for the second consecutive \nmonth, resulting in a widening of the trade deficit.21 Healthy services exports coupled \nwith strong remittance receipts are expected to keep CAD modest during 2025-26. \n15. \nOn the external financing side, gross foreign direct investment (FDI) to India \nincreased at a robust pace during the first half of the year. Net FDI also increased \nsignificantly due to a decline in repatriation despite a rise in outward FDI.22 Foreign \nportfolio investment (FPI) to India recorded net outflows of US$ 0.7 billion in 2025-26 \nso far (April-December 03), due to outflows in the equity segment. Flows under \nexternal commercial borrowings and non-resident deposit accounts moderated as \ncompared to last year.23 As on November 28, 2025, India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves \nstood at US$ 686.2 billion, providing a robust import cover of more than 11 months. \n \n17 Nearly 80 per cent of the CPI basket recorded less than 4 per cent inflation in October 2025, as \ncompared with 63 per cent in April and about 60 per cent a year ago. The CPI-Combined diffusion \nindex, a measure of dispersion of price changes, declined to 55.8, its lowest value since July 2020. \n \n18 As per the World Bank Commodity Price Forecasts (October 2025), energy, food, raw materials and \nfertiliser prices are projected to decline in 2026 from the 2025 levels. \n  \n19 India\u2019s services exports grew by 8.8 per cent (y-o-y) during Q2:2025-26, while services imports rose \nby 3.7 per cent with net services exports growing by 14.5 per cent during the same period. In October \n2025, services exports at US$ 35.2 billion grew at 2.2 per cent, while services imports at US$ 17.7 \nbillion increased by 2.9 per cent. Net services exports grew by 1.5 per cent and stood at US$ 17.4 \nbillion. \n20 India\u2019s inward remittances increased by 10.7 per cent (y-o-y) to US$ 39.0 billion in Q2:2025-26. \n21 In October 2025, India\u2019s merchandise exports contracted by 11.9 per cent on a y-o-y basis, whereas \nmerchandise imports rose by 16.9 per cent to reach an all-time high of US$ 76.1 billion, resulting in a \nwidening of the merchandise trade deficit to US$ 41.7 billion in October 2025.  \n22 Gross foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to India grew by 19.4 per cent to US$ 51.8 billion in April-\nSeptember 2025-26 from US$ 43.4 billion during the same period a year ago. Net FDI inflows increased \nby 127.6 per cent to US$ 7.7 billion in April-September 2025-26 from US$ 3.4 billion during the same \nperiod a year ago. \n23 Net inflows under external commercial borrowings to India moderated to US$ 6.2 billion during April-\nOctober 2025-26 from US$ 8.1 billion a year ago. Non-resident deposits recorded net inflows of US$ 6.1 \nbillion in April-September 2025-26, lower than US$ 10.2 billion in the same period last year. \n5 \n \nOverall, India\u2019s external sector remains resilient.24 We are confident of meeting our \nexternal financing requirements comfortably. \nLiquidity and Financial Market Conditions \n16. \nSystem liquidity, as measured by the net position under the LAF, stood at an \naverage surplus of \u20b91.5 lakh crore for the period since the MPC last met in October \n2025.25  \n17. \nMoney market rates have remained largely aligned to the policy repo rate \namidst comfortable liquidity conditions.26 G-sec yields have remained range-bound \nsince the last policy. In response to the cumulative 100 bps cut in the policy repo rate, \nthe weighted average lending rate (WALR) of Scheduled Commercial Banks has \ndeclined by 69 bps for fresh rupee loans during February-October 2025 (the interest \nrate effect27 is 78 bps). The moderation in the weighted average lending rate (WALR) \nof outstanding rupee loans has been to the extent of 63 bps. Transmission has been \nbroad-based across sectors. On the deposit side, the weighted average domestic term \ndeposit rate (WADTDR) on fresh deposits has declined by 105 bps, while that on \noutstanding deposits has softened by 32 bps over the same period.  \n18. \nI would like to reiterate that we are committed to provide sufficient durable \nliquidity to the banking system. We continuously assess the durable liquidity \nrequirements of the banking system due to changes in currency in circulation, forex \noperations, and reserve maintenance. Going forward too, we shall continue to do so. \nAfter reviewing the liquidity situation and the outlook, we have decided to conduct \nopen market operation (OMO) purchases of government securities amounting to \n\u20b91,00,000 crore and 3-year USD/INR Buy Sell swaps of USD 5 billion this month. The \ndetails will be notified separately later today. These measures will ensure adequate \ndurable liquidity in the system and further facilitate monetary transmission. \n19. \nI would also like to take this opportunity to clarify that injection (absorption) of \nliquidity through purchase (sale) of government securities under OMOs and that \nthrough operations under the LAF (VRR or VRRR) of short term duration serve very \ndifferent purposes. While the objective of purchase (sale) under OMO is to provide \n(absorb) durable liquidity, the purpose of repo operations is to manage transient \nliquidity so as to align the operating target \u2013 the Weighted Average Call Rate (WACR) \n\u2013 to the policy repo rate. So, it is quite possible that we inject durable liquidity through \npurchase of government securities under OMO on the one hand while simultaneously \nwithdrawing transient liquidity through a VRRR operation on the other hand. \n20. \nI would further like to reiterate that the primary instrument of monetary policy is \nthe policy repo rate.28 It is expected that changes in the short term interest rates will \n \n24 India\u2019s external debt to GDP ratio declined to 18.9 per cent at end-June 2025 from 19.1 per cent at \nend-March 2025, while the net international investment position (IIP) moderated to (-) 8.0 per cent of \nGDP at end-June 2025 from (-) 8.6 per cent of GDP at end-March 2025. \n25 The average daily net absorption under the LAF stood at \u20b92.9 lakh crore and \u20b91.6 lakh crore in \nAugust and September, respectively. The average daily net absorption under the LAF declined to \u20b90.9 \nlakh crore in October 2025 but improved to \u20b91.9 lakh crore in November 2025. As on December 03, net \nabsorption under the LAF stood at \u20b92.6 lakh crore.  \n26 In response to the cumulative policy repo rate cut of 100 bps in the current easing cycle (up to \nDecember 03), the WACR, the 3-month T-bill rate, the rate on 3-month CPs issued by NBFCs, and the \n3-month CD rate declined by 110 bps, 113 bps, 124 bps, and 140 bps, respectively. \n27 Interest rate effect on transmission to weighted average lending rate (WALR) is calculated by keeping \nthe weight constant (as of January 2025). \n \n28 We moved away from targeting money supply in 1998. \n \n6 \n \ntransmit to various long-term rates. At the same time, the primary purpose of open \nmarket operations is to provide sufficient liquidity and not to directly influence G-sec \nyields. \nFinancial Stability \n21. \nThe system-level financial parameters related to capital adequacy, liquidity, \nasset quality and profitability of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) continue to \nremain robust.29 Similarly, the system-level parameters of NBFCs too are sound, with \nadequate capital position and improved gross non-performing asset (GNPA) ratios30. \n22. \nThe total flow of resources to the commercial sector has strengthened, \nbolstered by greater non-bank intermediation. In the current financial year so far, the \ntotal flow of resources was \u20b920.1 lakh crore vis-\u00e0-vis \u20b916.5 lakh crore in the \ncorresponding period of the previous year. Outstanding credit from bank and non-bank \nsources increased by 13 per cent (y-o-y). \n23. \nBank credit growth too has seen an uptick in recent months.31 Sector-wise32 \ndata reveals that the growth was supported by sustained lending to retail and service \nsector segments. Industrial credit growth firmed up, aided by buoyant credit flow to \nmicro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Large industries also recorded \nimprovement in credit growth. \nAdditional Measures \n24. \nBefore I conclude, I have one additional measure to announce. \n25. \nWe have been focusing on improving customer services. We have taken a large \nnumber of measures in this regard. Re-KYC, financial inclusion and \u201cAapki Poonji, \nAapka Adhikar\u201d campaigns are some of the initiatives taken in association with other \nstakeholders. Earlier in the year, we reviewed our Citizens Charter too. We made \napplications for all our services online. We are publishing the summary of our monthly \ndisposal and pendency of various applications on the first of every month. I am happy \n \n29 SCB Parameters: The outstanding credit and deposit increased by 11.31per cent and 9.74per cent \non a y-o-y basis, respectively, between October-24 and October-25. The system-level Capital to Risk \nWeighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of 17.24 per cent in September 2025 was well above the regulatory \nminimum level. Ratio of non-performing loans improved further (GNPA ratio at 2.05 per cent in \nSeptember 2025 vis-\u00e0-vis 2.54 per cent in September 2024, NNPA Ratio at 0.48 per cent in September \n2025 vis-\u00e0-vis 0.57 per cent in September 2024). Liquidity buffers were robust, with an LCR of 131.69 \nper cent as of end September 2025. The annualised return on assets (RoA) and return on equity (RoE) \nstood at 1.32 per cent and 13.06 per cent, respectively, in September 2025. Net Interest Margin was \n3.26 per cent for September 2025 (3.52 per cent in September 2024). \n \n30 NBFC Parameters: Total CRAR of NBFCs was 25.11 per cent and Tier I CRAR was 23.27 per cent \nin September 2025, well above the minimum regulatory requirements. GNPA ratio has improved from \n2.57 per cent in September 2024 to 2.21 per cent in September 2025, while NNPA ratio also improved \nfrom 1.04 per cent in September 2024 to 0.99 per cent in September 2025. RoA for the sector \ndecreased from 3.25 per cent in September 2024 to 2.83 per cent in September 2025. NIM has \ndecreased from 5.51 per cent in September 2024 to 4.24 per cent in September 2025. \n \n31 On a year-on-year basis, bank credit registered a growth of 11.4 per cent as on November 14, 2025, \ncompared to 11.2 per cent a year ago. \n \n32 Sectoral non-food credit data are based on sector-wise and industry-wise bank credit (SIBC) return, \nwhich covers select banks accounting for about 95 per cent of total non-food credit extended by all \nSCBs, pertaining to the last reporting Friday of the month. Data available till October 2025. \n \n7 \n \nto note that more than 99.8 per cent of the applications are disposed of within \nstipulated timelines. \n26. \nHowever, in the recent past, as a result of, inter alia, receipt of a large number \nof grievances, pendency with the RBI Ombudsman has increased. I exhort all \nregulated entities to keep customers central in their policies and operations, improve \ncustomer service and reduce grievances. Further, we propose to hold a two-month \ncampaign from 1st January next year with an aim to resolve all grievances pending for \nmore than a month with the RBI Ombudsman. I elicit the support of all regulated \nentities in this endeavour.  \nConcluding Remarks \n27. \nLet me now conclude. Despite an unfavourable and challenging external \nenvironment, the Indian economy has shown remarkable resilience and is poised to \nregister high growth. The headroom provided by the inflation outlook has allowed us to \nremain growth supportive. We will continue to meet the productive requirements of the \neconomy in a proactive manner while ensuring macroeconomic stability.  \n28. \nThank you. Namaskar and Jai Hind. \n \n                      \n(Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1634                                        Chief General Manager \n \n \n",

The MPC members Dr. Nagesh Kumar, Shri Saugata Bhattacharya, Prof. Ram \nSingh, Dr. Poonam Gupta and Shri Indranil Bhattacharyya attended the meeting. \n \n2. \n After a detailed assessment of the evolving macroeconomic and financial \ndevelopments and the outlook, the MPC voted unanimously to reduce the policy repo \nrate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) to 5.25 per cent. Consequently, the \nstanding deposit facility (SDF) rate shall stand adjusted to 5.00 per cent and the \nmarginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 5.50 per cent. The MPC \nalso decided to continue with the neutral stance.  \n \nGrowth and Inflation Outlook \n \n3. \nThe global economy is holding up better than expected, though the earlier \nfrontloading of trade is showing signs of normalising. Uncertainty has eased somewhat \nfollowing the end of the US government shutdown and progress on trade agreements, \nyet it remains elevated. Global inflation dynamics remain uneven, with inflation \ntrending above target in most major advanced economies. The US dollar strengthened \nprimarily on safe haven demand while treasury yields remained range bound. Equity \nmarkets remain volatile, driven by shifting views on the monetary policy outlook and \nconcerns surrounding stretched valuations in tech stocks. \n \n4. \nIn India, real gross domestic product (GDP) registered a six-quarter high growth \nof 8.2 per cent in Q2:2025-26, underpinned by resilient domestic demand amidst \nglobal trade and policy uncertainties. On the supply side, real gross value added \n(GVA) expanded by 8.1 per cent, aided by buoyant industrial and services sectors. \nEconomic activity during the first half of the financial year benefited from income tax \nand goods and services tax (GST) rationalisation, softer crude oil prices, front-loading \nof government capital expenditure, and facilitative monetary and financial conditions \nsupported by benign inflation.  \n \n5. \nHigh-frequency indicators suggest that domestic economic activity is holding \nup in Q3, although there are some emerging signs of weakness in a few leading \nindicators. GST rationalisation and festival-related spending supported domestic \ndemand during October-November. Rural demand continues to be robust while urban \ndemand is recovering steadily. Investment activity remains healthy with private \ninvestment gaining steam on the back of expansion in non-food bank credit and high \n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u093f\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \ncapacity utilisation. Merchandise exports declined sharply in October amid subdued \nexternal demand, accompanied by softer services exports. On the supply side, \nagricultural growth is supported by healthy kharif crop production, higher reservoir \nlevels and better rabi crop sowing. Manufacturing activity continues to improve, and \nthe services sector is maintaining a steady pace.\n6.\nLooking ahead, domestic factors such as healthy agricultural prospects,\ncontinued impact of GST rationalisation, benign inflation, healthy balance sheets of\ncorporates and financial institutions and congenial monetary and financial conditions\nshould continue to support economic activity. Continuing reform initiatives would\nfurther facilitate growth. On the external front, services exports are likely to remain\nstrong, while merchandise exports face some headwinds. External uncertainties\ncontinue to pose downside risks to the outlook, while speedy conclusion of ongoing\ntrade and investment negotiations present upside potential. Taking all these factors\ninto consideration, real GDP growth for 2025-26 is projected at 7.3 per cent, with Q3\nat 7.0 per cent; and Q4 at 6.5 per cent. Real GDP growth for Q1:2026-27 is projected\nat 6.7 per cent and Q2 at 6.8 per cent (Chart 1). The risks are evenly balanced.\n7.\nHeadline CPI inflation declined to an all time low in October 2025. The faster\nthan anticipated decline in inflation was led by correction in food prices, contrary to the\nusual trend witnessed during the months of September-October. Core inflation (CPI\nheadline excluding food and fuel) remained largely contained in September-October,\ndespite continued price pressures exerted by precious metals. Excluding gold, core\ninflation moderated to 2.6 per cent in October. Overall, the decline in inflation has\nbecome more generalised.\n8.\nTurning to the inflation outlook, food supply prospects remain bright on the back\nof higher kharif production, healthy rabi sowing, adequate reservoir levels and\nconducive soil moisture. Barring some metals, international commodity prices are\nlikely to moderate going forward. Overall, inflation is likely to be softer than what was\nprojected in October, mainly on account of the fall in food prices. Considering all these\nfactors, CPI inflation for 2025-26 is now projected at 2.0 per cent with Q3 at 0.6 per\ncent; and Q4 at 2.9 per cent. CPI inflation for Q1:2026-27 and Q2 are projected at 3.9\nper cent and 4.0 per cent, respectively (Chart 2). In fact, the underlying inflation\npressures are even lower as the impact of increase in price of precious metals is about\n50 basis points (bps).   The risks are evenly balanced.\n3 \n \nRationale for Monetary Policy Decisions \n \n9. \nThe MPC noted that headline inflation has eased significantly and is likely to be \nsofter than the earlier projections, primarily on account of the exceptionally benign \nfood prices. Reflecting these favourable conditions, the projections for average \nheadline inflation in 2025-26 and Q1:2026-27 have been further revised downwards. \nCore inflation, which had been rising steadily since Q1:2024-25, eased at the margin \nin Q2:2025-26 and is expected to remain anchored in the period ahead. Both headline \nand core inflation are expected to be around the 4 per cent target during the first half \nof 2026-27. The underlying inflation pressures are even lower as the impact of \nincrease in price of precious metals is about 50 bps.  Growth, while remaining resilient, \nis expected to soften somewhat.  \n \n10. \nThus, the growth-inflation balance, especially the benign inflation outlook on \nboth headline and core, continues to provide the policy space to support the growth \nmomentum. Accordingly, the MPC unanimously voted to reduce the policy repo rate \nby 25 bps to 5.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the neutral stance. \nHowever, Prof. Ram Singh was of the view that the stance be changed from neutral \nto accommodative. \n \n11. \nThe minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on December 19, 2025. \n \n12. \nThe next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during February 4 to 6, 2026. \n \n \n \n                             \n             (Brij Raj)        \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1633                                            Chief General Manager \n \n \n \n",

With a \nview to harmonising the above instructions/ guidelines and consolidating them in one \nplace, Draft Master Direction (MD) on Business Authorization for Co-operative Banks \n(Directions), 2025 was issued on July 28, 2025 seeking feedback from banks and \nother stakeholders.  \n \n2. Feedback received on the draft MD has been examined and consequent \nmodifications have been suitably incorporated in the final Directions. A statement on \nthe feedback received for the draft Master Direction is provided in the Annex.  \n \n3. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank of India has today issued the following three \nRepeal Directions / Guidelines and one Amendment Direction to revise the extant \ninstructions applicable to co-operative banks: \n \n(1) \nReserve Bank of India (Urban Co-operative Banks \u2013 Licensing, Scheduling and \nRegulatory Classification) Repeal Guidelines, 2025 \n \n(2) \nReserve Bank of India (Urban Co-operative Banks \u2013 Branch Authorisation) \nRepeal Directions, 2025 \n \n(3) \nReserve Bank of India (Rural Co-operative Banks \u2013 Branch Authorisation) \nRepeal Directions, 2025 \n \n(4) \nReserve Bank of India (Rural Co-operative Banks \u2013 Miscellaneous) \n(Amendment) Directions, 2025 \n4. These revisions strike a balanced approach, empowering co-operative banks with \nenhanced operational autonomy while embedding robust safeguards. The calibrated \nrelaxation of authorization norms paves the way for cooperative banks to actively \ncontribute to India\u2019s economic growth by expanding credit outreach, leveraging \ntechnology-driven solutions, and supporting localized development priorities. \n \n \n \n \n               (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1627                                       Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

Given \nthe increasing reliance of CIs on credit information reports (CIRs) in credit \nunderwriting processes, it is imperative that the CIRs provided by CICs reflect more \nrecent information. Upon review, it was proposed to amend the extant instructions \nand transition to weekly incremental submission of credit information by CIs to CICs \nalong with measures to facilitate faster data submission and error rectification. \nAccordingly, the Reserve Bank had issued Draft Reserve Bank of India (Credit \nInformation Reporting) (1st Amendment) Directions, 2025, on September 29, \n2025, inviting public comments / feedback. \n \n2. Feedback received on the above draft Direction has been examined and suitably \nincorporated while finalising the same. A statement on the feedback received for the \ndraft Directions is provided in the Annex.  \n \n3. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank of India has today issued the following ten \nAmendment Directions to amend the extant instructions relating to credit information \nreporting process: \n \n1) Reserve Bank of India (Commercial Banks \u2013 Credit Information Reporting) \nAmendment Directions, 2025 \n \n2) Reserve Bank of India (Small Finance Banks \u2013 Credit Information Reporting) \nAmendment Directions, 2025 \n \n3) Reserve Bank of India (Local Area Banks \u2013 Credit Information Reporting) \nAmendment Directions, 2025 \n \n4) Reserve Bank of India (Regional Rural Banks \u2013 Credit Information Reporting) \nAmendment Directions, 2025 \n \n5) Reserve Bank of India (Urban Co-operative Banks \u2013 Credit Information Reporting) \nAmendment Directions, 2025 \n \n6) Reserve Bank of India (Rural Co-operative Banks \u2013 Credit Information Reporting) \nAmendment Directions, 2025 \n \n7) Reserve Bank of India (All India Financial Institutions \u2013 Credit Information \nReporting) Amendment Directions, 2025 \n \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n8) Reserve Bank of India (Non-Banking Financial Companies \u2013 Credit Information \nReporting) Amendment Directions, 2025 \n \n9) Reserve Bank of India (Asset Reconstruction Companies \u2013 Credit Information \nReporting) Amendment Directions, 2025 \n \n10) Reserve Bank of India (Credit Information Companies) Amendment Directions, \n2025 \n \n     Objective of these Amendment Directions is to ensure more frequent, accurate \nand timely reporting of credit information by CIs to CICs, thereby improving the \nquality and recency of CIRs used in credit underwriting and monitoring. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1626                                      Chief General Manager \n",
