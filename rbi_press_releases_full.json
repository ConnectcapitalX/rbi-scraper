The survey is for the reference \nperiod October \u2013 December 2025 (Q3:2025-26).  \n \n     The Reserve Bank has been conducting the Order Books, Inventories and Capacity \nUtilisation Survey (OBICUS) of the manufacturing sector on a quarterly basis since 2008. \nThe information collected in the survey includes quantitative data on new orders received \nduring the reference quarter, backlog of orders at the beginning of the quarter, pending \norders at the end of the quarter, total inventories with a breakup between \ufb01nished goods \n(FG), work-in-progress (WiP) and raw material (RM) inventories at the end of the quarter, \nitem-wise production in terms of quantity and value during the quarter vis-\u00e0-vis the \ninstalled capacity from the targeted group and the reasons for changes in production / \ninstalled capacity during the quarter. The level of capacity utilisation (CU) is estimated \nfrom these responses. The survey provides valuable input for monetary policy \nformulation. The survey findings are released on the website of the Bank regularly. \n \n     During this quarter, selected manufacturing companies will be approached by the \nBank. Other manufacturing companies may also participate in the survey by downloading \nthe survey questionnaire from the Reserve Bank\u2019s website https://www.rbi.org.in.
