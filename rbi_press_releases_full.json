    "file_extracted_text": " \n August 21, 2025 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on Ayodhya Finlease Limited \n \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated August 14, 2025, \nimposed a monetary penalty of \u20b91 lakh (Rupees One Lakh only) on Ayodhya \nFinlease Limited (the company) for non-compliance with certain provisions of 'Master \nDirection - Non-Banking Financial Company \u2013 Non-Systemically Important Non-\nDeposit taking Company (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016' read with \u2018Reserve Bank \nof India (Non-Banking Financial Company - Scale Based Regulation) Directions, \n2023\u2019 issued by RBI. This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred \non RBI under the provisions of Section 58G(1)(b) read with Section 58B(5)(aa) of the \nReserve Bank of India Act, 1934.  \n \n     The correspondence between RBI and the company revealed inter alia non-\ncompliance with RBI directions. Based on the same, a notice was issued to the \ncompany advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for \nits failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the company\u2019s reply to \nthe notice and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter \nalia, that the following charge against the company was sustained, warranting \nimposition of monetary penalty: \n \n     The company had failed to obtain prior written permission of RBI for change in \nshareholding in excess of 26 percent of its paid-up equity capital. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \ncompany with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the company. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/949                                               Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
