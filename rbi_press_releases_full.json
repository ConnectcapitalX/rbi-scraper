The market participants can bid in the switch auction through the Switch Transaction \nmodule provided in the e-Kuber portal. \nBidding in a switch transaction \n \n2. Bidding in the auction implies that the market participants agree to sell the source \nsecurity/ies to the Government of India (GoI) and simultaneously agree to buy the \ndestination security from the GoI at their respective quoted prices. \n \nPlacing of bids \n \n3. Each bid should specify the following details: \n \nI. \nAmount of the source security (Face Value) that the participants are willing to sell. \nII. \nPrice of the source security (expressed up to two decimal places). \nIII. \nChoice of destination security and the price of the destination security (expressed up to \ntwo decimal places), at which the participants are willing to buy the destination security. \n \n4. The participants can choose to bid for any/all the destination security/ies, but the \naggregate amount of bids for the source security should not exceed their holdings of the \nsource security in face value terms. \n \nMinimum Bid size \n \n5. Minimum bid size would be \u20b910,000 and in multiples of \u20b910,000 thereafter. The \nparticipants are allowed to submit multiple bids. However, the aggregate amount of bids \nsubmitted should not exceed the notified amount of source security/basket of source \nsecurities in the auction. \n \nPrice of source security \n \n6. The price of the source security quoted must be equal to the FBIL closing price of \nthe source security as on the previous working day. \n \n7. Bids for source security not as per the price mentioned above will be rejected. \n \nPrice of destination security \n \n8. Bids for the destination security may be placed after taking into account the price of \nsource security as mentioned above. \n \nMethod of auction \n \n9. The auction will be a multiple-price based auction, i.e. successful bids will get accepted \nat their respective quoted prices for the source and destination securities. \nAuction decision \n \n10. The auction cut-off will be decided based on the price of the destination \nsecurity/ies. \n \n11. Successful bidders are those who have placed their bids at or above the cut-off price. \nAll bids lower than the cut-off price will be rejected. \n \n4 \n \n12. There will be provision of pro-rata allotment, should there be more than one \nsuccessful bid at the cut-off price. \n \nAmount of destination security and dealing in odd amounts during switch auction \n \n13. The switch ratio, which is the ratio of the price of the source security to the price of \nthe destination security, would be rounded off at 8 decimal places. \n \n14. The amount of destination security to be issued for each successful bid will be \ncomputed by multiplying the allotted amount (FV) of the source security with the rounded-\noff switch ratio. The amount of destination security (FV) would be rounded-off to the \nnearest lower value in multiples of \u20b910,000. \n \n15. The odd amount of destination securities (less than \u20b910,000) which has been \nrounded-off, would be notionally allotted and bought back from the bidders at the quoted \nbid price of the destination security. The net cash consideration to be paid to the bidder \nfor such odd amounts would be the clean price of these securities (as the accrued \ninterest received during notional allotment and paid during notional buyback offset each \nother). \n \nFund settlement \n \n16. Though the conversion would be broadly cash neutral, there will be fund settlement \nfor the net accrued interest (accrued interest for the source security FV \u2013 accrued interest \nfor the destination security FV) for each bid. Cash consideration (due to rounding-off of \nface value of destination security) computed for each bid would be added to the net \naccrued interest.  Accordingly, fund settlement will be done for the final amount (Net \naccrued interest + cash consideration) for each bid. \n \nNote: An illustration for the calculation of cash consideration due to rounding-off of \ndestination security face value is as given below: \n \nAmount of Source Security (FV) \n\u20b910,00,00,000.00 \nPrice of Source Security  \n\u20b997.50 \nPrice of Destination Security  \n\u20b999.20 \nSwitch Ratio (rounded-off at 8 decimals) \n0.98286290 \nDestination Security FV before rounding off  \n\u20b99,82,86,290.00 \nDestination Security FV re-issued after rounding-off  \n\u20b99,82,80,000.00 \nOdd amount of rounded-off destination security (FV) \n\u20b96290.00 \nCash consideration due to rounding off (Clean Price \ncalculated at the quoted price of destination security) \n\u20b96240.00 \n \n17. The settlement of the auction would be held on T+1 basis. \n \nHelp Desk \n \n18. In case of technical difficulties, Core Banking Operations Team should be contacted \n(email; Phone no: 022-69870466, 022-69870415).

In due course, the flow of shipping bills from the \nCustoms Authority has been automated through ICEGATE and from January, 2022, \ndata from ECCS (Express Cargo Clearance System) also started flowing into \nEDPMS. Further, postal exports bill data also started flowing into EDPMS from \nJanuary, 2025. \n \n2. Over the years, there has been significant increase in the number of export \ntransactions that flow into the EDPMS, wherein each shipping bill is reconciled \nagainst payment received. With the objective of easing compliance, especially for \nexporters of small value goods, it has been decided to simplify the process of \nreconciliation in EDPMS. Accordingly, draft Directions have been prepared to \naddress the issues related to regulatory compliance involving reconciliation of small-\nvalue exports in the EDPMS.  \n \n3. Comments/ feedback on the draft Directions may be submitted through the link \nunder the \u2018Connect 2 Regulate\u2019 Section available on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website or \nmay alternatively be forwarded via email by July 31, 2025, with the subject \nline \u201cFeedback on draft directions on closure of shipping bills in EDPMS\u201d. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/705                                               Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

    "file_extracted_text": " \n July 11, 2025 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on Shriram Finance Limited \n \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated July 08, 2025, imposed a \nmonetary penalty of \u20b92.70 lakh (Rupees Two Lakh Seventy Thousand only) on \nShriram Finance Limited (the company) for non-compliance with certain provisions of \nthe \u201cReserve Bank of India (Digital Lending) Directions, 2025\u201d issued by RBI. This \npenalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under clause (b) of \nsub-section (1) of Section 58G read with clause (aa) of sub-section (5) of Section \n58B of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the company was conducted by RBI with reference to \nits financial position as on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice \nwas issued to the company advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be \nimposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions.  \n \n     After considering the company\u2019s reply to the notice, additional submissions made \nby it and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, \nthat the following charge against the company was sustained, warranting imposition \nof monetary penalty:  \n \n     The company routed the loan repayments through the account of a third-party, \ninstead of the borrowers directly crediting the loan repayments to the company\u2019s \naccount. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \ncompany with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the company. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/701                                               Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

Further, Myanmar was added \nto the list of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action in the October 2022 FATF \nplenary and FATF has called on its members and other jurisdictions to apply enhanced \ndue diligence measures proportionate to the risk arising from Myanmar. When applying \nenhanced due diligence measures, countries have been advised to ensure that flows of \nfunds for humanitarian assistance, legitimate NPO activity and remittances are not \ndisrupted. The status of Myanmar in the list of countries subject to a call for action, \nremains unchanged. \n \n     FATF had earlier identified the following jurisdictions as having strategic deficiencies \nin their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation \nfinancing and had placed the jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring, which had \ndeveloped action plan with the FATF to deal with them. These jurisdictions were:  Algeria, \nAngola, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Croatia, Democratic Republic \nof the Congo, Haiti, Kenya, Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Lebanon, \nMali, Monaco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, South Sudan, Syria, \nTanzania, Venezuela, Vietnam and Yemen. As per the June 13, 2025 FATF public \nstatement, Bolivia and the Virgin Islands (UK) have been added to the list of Jurisdictions \nunder Increased Monitoring while Croatia, Mali and Tanzania have been removed from \nthis list based on review by the FATF. \n \n     FATF plenary releases documents titled \u201cHigh-Risk jurisdictions subject to a Call for \nAction\u201d and \u201cJurisdictions under Increased Monitoring\u201d with respect to jurisdictions that \nhave strategic AML/CFT deficiencies as part of the ongoing efforts to identify and work \nwith jurisdictions with strategic Anti-Money Laundering (AML)/Combating of Financing of \nTerrorism (CFT) deficiencies. This advice does not preclude the regulated entities from \nlegitimate trade and business transactions with these countries and jurisdictions \nmentioned there.  \n \n     The detailed information is available in the updated public statements and document \nreleased by FATF on June 13, 2025.
