No. \nNGP.DOS.SSM 3.No.S403/15-04-395/2025-2026 dated July 29, 2025, has issued \ncertain Directions to Sonpeth Nagari Sahakari Bank Maryadit, Sonpeth, (\u201cthe \nbank\u201d), whereby, as from the close of business on July 30, 2025, the bank shall not, \nwithout prior approval of RBI in writing, grant or renew any loans and advances, \nmake any investment, incur any liability including borrowal of funds and acceptance \nof fresh deposits, disburse or agree to disburse any payment whether in discharge of \nits liabilities and obligations or otherwise, enter into any compromise or arrangement \nand sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets except as \nnotified in the RBI Direction dated July 29, 2025, a copy of which has been directed \nto be displayed on the bank's website / premises for perusal by interested members \nof the public. Considering the bank's current liquidity position, the bank has been \ndirected not to allow withdrawal of any amount from savings bank or current accounts \nor any other account of a depositor but is allowed to set off loans against deposits \nsubject to the conditions stated in the above RBI Directions. The bank may incur \nexpenditure in respect of certain essential items such as salaries of employees, rent, \nelectricity bills, etc., as specified in the said Directions. \n \n2. RBI has in the recent past engaged with the Board and Senior Management of the \nbank for improvement in its functioning. However, lack of concrete efforts taken by \nthe bank to address the supervisory concerns and to protect the interest of depositors \nof the bank, necessitated issuance of these Directions.  \n \n3. The eligible depositors would be entitled to receive deposit insurance claim \namount of their deposits up to a monetary ceiling of \u20b95,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakh \nonly) in the same capacity and in the same right, from the Deposit Insurance and \nCredit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), as applicable under the provisions of the \nDICGC Act, 1961, based on submission of willingness by the depositors concerned \nand after due verification. The depositors may contact the bank officials for further \ninformation. Details may also be accessed on the DICGC website: www.dicgc.org.in. \n \n4. The issue of the above Directions by the RBI should not per se be construed as \ncancellation of the banking license by RBI. The bank will continue to undertake \nbanking business subject to restrictions specified in the said Directions till its financial \nposition improves.

Based on supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice \nwas issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be \nimposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the \nbank's reply to the notice, oral submissions made during the personal hearing and \nadditional submissions made by it, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charges \nagainst the bank were sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: \n \nThe bank had failed to: \n \ni) implement certain cyber security controls prescribed by RBI under the \nComprehensive Cyber Security Framework; and \nii) carry out periodic updation of KYC of certain customers as per the prescribed \nperiodicity. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/795                                               Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

    "file_extracted_text": " \n July 28, 2025 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on The Batlagundu Co-operative Urban Bank \nLimited, Tamil Nadu \n \n    The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated July 21, 2025, imposed a \nmonetary penalty of \u20b91 lakh (Rupees One Lakh only) on The Batlagundu Co-\noperative Urban Bank Limited, Tamil Nadu (the bank) for non-compliance with certain \ndirections issued by RBI on \u2018Prudential Norms on Capital Adequacy \u2013 Primary \n(Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs)\u2019 and specific directions issued by RBI under \n\u2018Supervisory Action Framework (SAF)\u2019. This penalty has been imposed in exercise of \npowers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read with \nSections 46(4)(i) and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. \n  \n    The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by RBI with reference to its \nfinancial position as on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice \nwas issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be \nimposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the \nbank\u2019s reply to the notice and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, \nRBI found, inter alia, that the following charges against the bank were sustained, \nwarranting imposition of monetary penalty: \n \nThe bank had:  \ni) sanctioned certain loans without complying with the share linking to \nborrowings norm, despite its CRAR being less than regulatory minimum; and \nii) sanctioned fresh loans and advances carrying risk- weight of more than 100% \nand also breached the single borrower exposure limit applicable for fresh \nloans and advances in certain instances, in non-adherence to directions \nissued under SAF. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/794                                               Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
