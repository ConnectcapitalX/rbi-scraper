The survey2 collects details on India\u2019s exports of software services {computer \nservices and ITES/business process outsourcing (BPO) services} as per type of activity, \non-site/off-site nature of services, country of destination and modes of supply. \n  \nFor 2024-25 round of the survey, 6,766 software export companies were contacted, of \nwhich 2,206 companies, including most of the large companies, responded. The \nparticipating companies together accounted around 90 per cent of total software services \nexports3 (Table 1). \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 Exports of software services by the Indian companies (excluding their sales \nthrough overseas commercial presence) are estimated to have increased by 7.3 \nper cent during 2024-25 to US$ 204.7 billion (Table 2). \n \n\u2022 Computer services continued to account for over two-thirds of India\u2019s total \nsoftware services exports during the year; BPO services remained the major \ncomponent of ITES exports (Tables 2 and 3). \n \n\u2022 While private limited companies recorded a growth of 11.6 per cent in the total \nexport of software services during the year, exports by public limited companies \nincreased marginally by 1.3 per cent (Table 4). \n \n\u2022 Software exports to the United States of America (USA) increased at a lower pace \nof 4.9 per cent compared to 14.3 per cent growth for Europe. As a result, the share \nof USA in total software exports declined from 54.1 per cent during 2023-24 to \n52.9 per cent during 2024-25. On the contrary, the share of Europe increased from \n30.8 per cent to 32.8 per cent (Table 5). \n  \n \n1 The previous data release in the series, covering 2023-24 survey round, was published on October 18, 2024, on the RBI website. \n2 The survey schedule is given in the Annex. \n3 Exports of relatively small non-responding companies have been estimated as per the methodology published in the article titled \n\u2018Survey on Computer Software and Information Technology Enabled Services Exports, 2016-17\u2019 on March 2018 issue of the \nReserve Bank of India Bulletin. \n \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n\u2022 The US Dollar was the principal invoicing currency constituting 72.0 per cent of \nIndia\u2019s software exports, followed by the Euro (9.6 per cent), the INR (7.1 per cent) \nand the Pound Sterling (6.0 per cent) (Table 6). \n \n\u2022 The share of off-site mode in total exports of software services was 90.7 per cent \nin 2024-25 (Table 7). \n \n\u2022 Total software export services, including services delivered by foreign affiliates of \nIndian companies, increased by 6.5 per cent during 2024-25 and stood at US$ \n218.6 billion Contribution of cross-border supply mode in total export of software \nservices increased from 83.5 per cent in 2023-24 to 84.8 per cent during 2024-25, \nhowever share of other modes had declined (Table 8). \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                Ajit Prasad \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1446                                                 Deputy General Manager  \n                                                                                                     (Communications)                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nTable 1: Survey Response and Final Estimates for 2024-25 \u2013 A Snapshot \nItem \nReported \nFinal Estimates \n\u20b9 crore \nUS$ \nbillion \n\u20b9 crore \nUS$ \nbillion \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n1.

Further, Myanmar was added \nto the list of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action in the October 2022 FATF \nplenary and FATF has called on its members and other jurisdictions to apply enhanced \ndue diligence measures proportionate to the risk arising from Myanmar. When applying \nenhanced due diligence measures, countries have been advised to ensure that flows of \nfunds for humanitarian assistance, legitimate NPO activity and remittances are not \ndisrupted. The status of Myanmar in the list of countries subject to a call for action, \nremains unchanged. \n  \n     FATF had earlier identified the following jurisdictions as having strategic deficiencies \nin their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation \nfinancing and had placed the jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring, which had \ndeveloped action plan with the FATF to deal with them. These jurisdictions were:  \nAlgeria, Angola, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, Haiti, Kenya, Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), \nLebanon, Monaco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, South Sudan, \nSyria, Venezuela, Vietnam, Virgin Islands (UK) and Yemen.

The November 2025 round of the survey is being \nlaunched. The survey aims at capturing subjective assessments on price movements and \ninflation, based on their individual consumption baskets, across 19 cities, viz., \nAhmedabad, Bengaluru, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, Chandigarh, Chennai, Delhi, Guwahati, \nHyderabad, Jaipur, Jammu, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, Nagpur, Patna, Raipur, Ranchi \nand Thiruvananthapuram. The survey seeks qualitative responses from households on \nprice changes (general prices as well as prices of specific product groups) in the three \nmonths ahead as well as in the one year ahead period and quantitative responses on \ncurrent, three months ahead and one year ahead inflation rates. The results of this \nsurvey provide useful inputs for monetary policy. \n \n     The agency, M/s Hansa Research Group Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai has been engaged to \nconduct the survey of this round on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India. For this purpose, \nthe selected households will be approached by the agency, and they are requested to \nprovide their response.

Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                     (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1418                                            Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

One of the challenges with speed of cross-border payments is the \ndelay between receipt of the payment at the beneficiary bank and credit to the \nbeneficiary account. This draft circular aims to address some of the frictions for \nfacilitating timely intimation of payment information and credit to the beneficiary\u2019s \naccount. \n \n \n \n \n               (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1410                                        Chief General Manager \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

    "file_extracted_text": " \n October 29, 2025 \n \nCensus on Foreign Liabilities and Assets of Indian Direct Investment  \nEntities for 2024-25  \n \n     Today, the Reserve Bank released the provisional results of the 2024-251 round of the \nannual census on foreign liabilities and assets (FLA) covering cross-border liabilities and \nassets of the Indian entities {viz., companies, limited liability partnerships (LLPs), \nalternative investment funds (AIFs) and partnership firms} with inward/outward direct \ninvestment (DI). \n \n     Out of the 45,702 entities which responded in the latest census, 41,517 reported foreign \ndirect investment (FDI) and/or overseas direct investment (ODI) in their balance sheet for \nMarch 2025. Of these entities, 33,637 had also reported in the previous census round and \n7,880 have newly reported in the current round. Over three-fourths of the companies that \nreported inward direct investment were subsidiaries of foreign companies (i.e., single \nforeign investor holding more than 50 per cent of total equity). \n \n     The census captures detailed information on (a) market value of liabilities and assets of \nIndian DI entities arising on account of cross-border direct and other investments; and (b) \ntrade parameters (viz., activity sector, sales, purchase, exports, and imports), in addition to \nidentification particulars of a reporting entity. The variations in outstanding assets / liabilities \nbetween the beginning and end of a financial year would be different from flows recorded \nin India\u2019s balance of payments (BoP) statistics during the year, as the former would also \ninclude valuation changes due to price and exchange rate movements. \nMain Findings: \n\u2022 More than 97 per cent of the responding DI entities were unlisted in March 2025 and \nthat captured most of the FDI equity capital in India (Tables 1 and 2A).  \n\u2022 Non-financial companies held 90.5 per cent of the FDI equity at face value (Table 2B). \n\u2022 The market value of total FDI in unlisted2 companies surpassed that in listed companies \nas at end-March 2025 (Table 3A). \n\u2022 In terms of market value, the growth of ODI (17.9 per cent) outpaced the growth of FDI \n(11.1 per cent) in India, in rupee terms during 2024-25. As a result, the ratio of inward to \noutward DI stood at 5.9 times in March 2025 as compared to 6.3 time a year ago (Table \n3B). \n \n1 The previous data release in the series, covering 2023-24 census round, was published on October 11, \n2024, on the RBI website. \n2 Market value of equity of unlisted companies is compiled as per the own fund book value (OFBV) method \nprescribed in the Co-ordinated Direct Investment Survey Guide (2015) of the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF).  \n \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n\u2022 Other investment liabilities {viz., trade credit, loans, currency and deposits, and other \npayable with unrelated (third party) non-resident entities} recorded a growth of 7.2 per \ncent during 2024-25 in the US dollar terms. Their corresponding assets also recorded a \ngrowth of 12.5 per cent during the year and covered 46.8 per cent of such liabilities \n(Table 4). \n\u2022 The United States and Singapore together accounted for over one-third of the FDI in \nIndia; other top sources included Mauritius, the United Kingdom and Netherlands. In \ncase of ODI also, Singapore, the United States and the United Kingdom were the top \ndestinations (Tables 5 and 6). \n\u2022 Manufacturing sector accounted for the highest share of total FDI equity capital at market \nvalue (48.4 per cent) as well as at face value (37.8 per cent) (Tables 7 and 8). \n\u2022 The services sector was the second highest shareholder in total FDI equity capital at \nmarket value.
