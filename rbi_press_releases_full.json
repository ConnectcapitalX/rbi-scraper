State of the Economy; II. Resilience and Revival: India\u2019s \nPrivate Corporate Sector; III. Fundraising by Indian Small and Medium Enterprises \nthrough IPO: Recent Trends and Developments; IV. Compliance to Confidence: A Data \nQuality Model for Central Banks; and V. Steel Under Siege: Understanding the Impact \nof Dumping on India. \nI. \nState of the Economy \n     Global uncertainty has edged up. In the US, both trade and economic policy \nuncertainty increased in September. Global growth, however, has broadly held up. \nInvestor sentiments dampened in October, on renewed US-China trade tensions and \nprolonged US government shutdown, after a phase of buoyancy. The Indian economy \ndisplayed resilience amidst broader global uncertainty and weak external demand. \nHigh-frequency indicators point to a revival in urban demand and robust rural demand. \nHeadline consumer price index (CPI) inflation moderated sharply in September, \nmarking its lowest reading since June 2017. \nII. \nResilience and Revival: India\u2019s Private Corporate Sector \nBy Snigdha Yogindran, Sukti Khandekar, Rajesh Kavediya and Kamal Gupta \n     The study highlights how India\u2019s private corporates navigated the COVID pandemic \nshock and emerged stronger. Based on financial data of listed non-government non-\nfinancial companies, the study underscores the sector\u2019s ability to withstand global \nshocks with adaptability, profitability, and strengthening of balance sheets in the post-\npandemic period.  \nHighlights: \n\u2022 Corporate sales rebounded sharply post-pandemic, peaking at 32.5 per cent \ngrowth in 2021-22 over the contraction recorded during the pandemic period, \nbefore stabilising at 7.2 per cent in 2024-25. \n\u2022 Net profits rose significantly to \u20b97.1 trillion in 2024-25 from \u20b92.5 trillion in 2020-21. \nConsequently, the net profit margin improved to 10.3 per cent during 2024-25 from \n7.2 per cent in 2020-21.  \n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u093f\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central O\ufb03ce, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n\u2022 Corporates continued to deleverage their balance sheet supported by \ncapitalisation of higher profit, with debt-to-equity ratios improving across firm sizes. \n\u2022 Interest coverage ratio for manufacturing firms improved significantly, reaching 7.7, \non an average during post-COVID period, reflecting robust debt-servicing capacity. \n\u2022 Large firms drove profitability, while medium and small firms demonstrated greater \nimprovement in debt servicing capacity than the large firms.  \nIII. \nFundraising by Indian Small and Medium Enterprises through IPO: Recent \nTrends and Developments \nBy Bhagyashree Chattopadhyay and Shromona Ganguly \n     Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are vital to India\u2019s economic growth, but \noften face constraints in accessing formal finance. In recent years, dedicated SME \nexchanges have emerged as an important platform for fundraising through Initial \nPublic Offerings (IPOs). This article examines the performance and trends of SME \nIPOs in India during FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25, analysing their evolution, market \nbehaviour, and investors\u2019 response. \nHighlights: \n\u2022 \nThe SME IPO market in India saw a sharp surge in activity during FY 2023-24 and \nFY 2024-25, supported by strong retail participation, and favourable market \nsentiment. During most of this time, SME IPOs recorded high oversubscription \nlevels and listing gains.  \n\u2022 \nMacroeconomic and policy factors like overall market buoyancy, and advancement \nin payment and settlement mechanism in the IPO market drove this boom.  \n\u2022 \nMost IPO proceeds were used for capital enhancement or working capital purpose \nby the SMEs. Despite robust listing gain, post-listing performances of these SME \nstocks reveal both opportunities and risks for the investors.  \nIV. \nCompliance to Confidence: A Data Quality Model for Central Banks \nBy Debasis Nandi and Sujeesh Kumar \n     The functioning of the central bank involves collection of huge volume of banking \nand financial sector data from the regulated entities. In the complex data ecosystem, \nensuring the quality of data becomes challenging for central banks. As the central bank \nis entrusted with collection of various type of data - regulatory, supervisory and \nstatistical, this article presents an approach for constructing a data quality index (DQI) \nto evaluate the quality of data submitted by regulated entities.  \nHighlights: \n\u2022 \nThe methodology described in this article outlines a stepwise approach for \nconstructing the DQI using eight data quality dimensions. It broadens upon four \ndata quality dimensions typically applied in the Indian banking supervisory \nlandscape, encompassing data collection and dissemination processes. \n\u2022 \nThe DQI framework provided in this article enables central banks and regulators to \nmonitor and improve data quality systematically enhancing institutional credibility, \nregulatory and supervisory efficiency, and public trust. \n3 \n \n\u2022 \nThe framework highlights the significance of automation in data generation and \ncollection processes for enhancement of data quality in the institutional data \ngovernance. \nV. \nSteel Under Siege: Understanding the Impact of Dumping on India \nBy Anirban Sanyal and Sanjay Singh \n     India's steel sector faced significant headwinds due to cheap imports and dumping \nfrom major global steel producers during 2023-24 and 2024-25. Against the backdrop, \nthis paper analyses the impact of cheap imports on India\u2019s domestic production and \nconsumption of steel at aggregate level. Further, the price sensitivity of steel imports \nis evaluated through average import elasticity across import destinations. \nHighlights: \n\u2022 Steel imports have seen a surge largely driven by lower import price of steel and it \nimpacted the domestic production of steel adversely. \n\u2022 The average price elasticity of India's steel imports varies in the range of 0.73-1.01 \nwhich suggests that given the strong domestic demand of steel products, the \nimport intensity was elevated primarily due to price effects. Lower price point from \nimports led to a substitution of domestically produced steel to meet the elevated \nsteel demand. \n\u2022 The dumping of cheap steel from global producers may pose a risk to the domestic \nsteel production which can be mitigated through suitable policy measures. The \nrecent initiative to impose the safeguard duty provides insulation against the import \ndumping. \n     The views expressed in the Bulletin articles are of the authors and do not represent \nthe views of the Reserve Bank of India. \n \n \n                              \n                (Brij Raj)        \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1355                                             Chief General Manager \n \n",

This penalty \nhas been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of \nSection 47A(1)(c) read with Sections 46(4)(i) and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, \n1949. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by RBI with reference to its \nfinancial position as on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice \nwas issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be \nimposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the \nbank\u2019s reply to the notice and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, \nRBI found, inter alia, that the following charges against the bank were sustained, \nwarranting imposition of monetary penalty: \n \nThe bank had failed to:  \ni) carry out periodic review of risk categorisation of accounts, with such periodicity \nbeing at least once in six months; and \nii) upload KYC records of customers onto Central KYC Records Registry \n(CKYCR) within the prescribed timeline.  \n \n    This action is based on deficiency in regulatory compliance and is not intended to \npronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank \nwith its customers.

The market participants can bid in the switch auction through the Switch Transaction \nmodule provided in the e-Kuber portal. \nBidding in a switch transaction \n2. Bidding in the auction implies that the market participants agree to sell the source \nsecurity/ies to the Government of India (GoI) and simultaneously agree to buy the destination \nsecurity from the GoI at their respective quoted prices. \nPlacing of bids \n3. Each bid should specify the following details: \nI. \nAmount of the source security (Face Value) that the participants are willing to sell. \nII. \nPrice of the source security (expressed up to two decimal places). \nIII. \nChoice of destination security and the price of the destination security (expressed up \nto two decimal places), at which the participants are willing to buy the destination \nsecurity. \n4. The participants can choose to bid for any/all the destination security/ies, but the aggregate \namount of bids for the source security should not exceed their holdings of the source security \nin face value terms.   \nMinimum Bid size \n5. Minimum bid size would be \u20b910,000 and in multiples of \u20b910,000 thereafter. The participants \nare allowed to submit multiple bids. However, the aggregate amount of bids submitted should \nnot exceed the notified amount of source security/basket of source securities in the auction.  \nPrice of source security \n6. The price of the source security quoted must be equal to the FBIL closing price of the \nsource security as on the previous working day. \n7. Bids for source security not as per the price mentioned above will be rejected.  \nPrice of destination security \n8. Bids for the destination security may be placed after taking into account the price of source \nsecurity as mentioned above.  \nMethod of auction \n9. The auction will be a multiple-price based auction, i.e. successful bids will get accepted at \ntheir respective quoted prices for the source and destination securities. \nAuction decision \n10. The auction cut-off will be decided based on the price of the destination security/ies. \n11. Successful bidders are those who have placed their bids at or above the cut-off price. All \nbids lower than the cut-off price will be rejected. \n12. There will be provision of pro-rata allotment, should there be more than one successful bid \nat the cut-off price.  \nAmount of destination security and dealing in odd amounts during switch auction \n13. The switch ratio, which is the ratio of the price of the source security to the price of the \ndestination security, would be rounded off at 8 decimal places. \n \n14. The amount of destination security to be issued for each successful bid will be computed \nby multiplying the allotted amount (FV) of the source security with the rounded-off switch ratio. \nThe amount of destination security (FV) would be rounded-off to the nearest lower value in \nmultiples of \u20b910,000.  \n15. The odd amount of destination securities (less than \u20b910,000) which has been rounded-off, \nwould be notionally allotted and bought back from the bidders at the quoted bid price of the \ndestination security. The net cash consideration to be paid to the bidder for such odd amounts \nwould be the clean price of these securities (as the accrued interest received during notional \nallotment and paid during notional buyback offset each other). \nFund settlement \n16. Though the conversion would be broadly cash neutral, there will be fund settlement for the \nnet accrued interest (accrued interest for the source security FV \u2013 accrued interest for the \ndestination security FV) for each bid. Cash consideration (due to rounding-off of face value of \ndestination security) computed for each bid would be added to the net accrued interest.  \nAccordingly, fund settlement will be done for the final amount (Net accrued interest + cash \nconsideration) for each bid. \nNote: An illustration for the calculation of cash consideration due to rounding-off of \ndestination security face value is as given below: \nAmount of Source Security (FV) \n\u20b910,00,00,000.00 \nPrice of Source Security  \n\u20b997.50 \nPrice of Destination Security  \n\u20b999.20 \nSwitch Ratio (rounded-off at 8 decimals) \n0.98286290 \nDestination Security FV before rounding off  \n\u20b99,82,86,290.00 \nDestination Security FV re-issued after rounding-off  \n\u20b99,82,80,000.00 \nOdd amount of rounded-off destination security (FV) \n\u20b96290.00 \nCash consideration due to rounding off (Clean Price \ncalculated at the quoted price of destination security) \n\u20b96240.00 \n17. The settlement of the auction would be held on T+1 basis. \nHelp Desk \n18. In case of technical difficulties, Core Banking Operations Team should be contacted \n(email; Phone no: 022-69870466, 022-69870415). For other auction related difficulties, IDMD \nauction team can be contacted (email; Phone no: 022-22702431, 22705125). \n",

The global economy has been more resilient than anticipated in 2025, with robust \ngrowth in the US and China. The outlook, however, remains clouded amidst elevated \npolicy uncertainty. Inflation has remained above their respective targets in some \nadvanced economies, posing fresh challenges for central banks as they navigate the \nshifting growth-inflation dynamics. Financial markets have been volatile.  The US \ndollar strengthened after the upward revision of US growth numbers for the second \nquarter, and treasury yields hardened recently tracking changes in policy rate \nexpectations. Equities have remained buoyant across several advanced and \nemerging market economies.  \n \n8. In India, real gross domestic product (GDP), driven by strong private consumption \nand fixed investment, recorded a robust growth of 7.8 per cent in Q1:2025-26. On the \nsupply side, growth in gross value added (GVA) at 7.6 per cent was led by a revival \nin manufacturing and steady expansion in services. Available high frequency \nindicators suggest that economic activity continues to remain resilient. Rural demand \nremains strong, riding on a good monsoon and robust agriculture activity, while urban \ndemand is showing a gradual revival. Revenue expenditure of the Union and State \nGovernments registered robust growth during the fiscal year so far (April-July). \nInvestment activity, as suggested by healthy growth in construction indicators i.e., \ncement production and steel consumption in July-August, is holding up well even \nthough production and import of capital goods witnessed some moderation. Recovery \nin manufacturing sector continues while services activity is sustaining its momentum.   \n \n9. Looking ahead, an above normal monsoon, good progress of kharif sowing and \nadequate reservoir levels have further brightened prospects of agriculture and rural \ndemand. Buoyancy in services sector coupled with steady employment conditions \nare supportive of demand, which is expected to get a further boost from the \nrationalisation of goods and services tax (GST) rates. Rising capacity utilisation, \nconducive financial conditions, and improving domestic demand should continue to \nfacilitate fixed investment. However, ongoing tariff and trade policy uncertainties will \nimpact external demand for goods and services. Prolonged geopolitical tensions and \nvolatility in international financial markets caused by risk-off sentiments of investors \nalso pose downside risks to the growth outlook. The implementation of several \ngrowth-inducing structural reforms, including streamlining of GST are expected to \noffset some of the adverse effects of the external headwinds. Taking all these factors \ninto account, real GDP growth for 2025-26 is now projected at 6.8 per cent, with Q2 \nat 7.0 per cent, Q3 at 6.4 per cent, and Q4 at 6.2 per cent. Real GDP growth for \nQ1:2026-27 is projected at 6.4 per cent (Chart 1). The risks are evenly balanced. \n \n10. Headline CPI inflation declined to its eight-year low of 1.6 per cent (y-o-y) in July \n2025 before rising to 2.1 per cent in August \u2013 its first increase after nine months. \nBenign inflation conditions during 2025-26 so far have been primarily driven by a \nsharp decline in food inflation from its peak of October 2024. Inflation within the fuel \ngroup moved in a narrow range of 2.4-2.7 per cent during June-August. Core inflation \nremained largely contained at 4.2 per cent in August. Excluding precious metals, core \ninflation was at 3.0 per cent in August. \n \n3 \n \n11. In terms of the inflation outlook for H2: 2025-26, healthy progress of the south-\nwest monsoon, higher kharif sowing, adequate reservoir levels and comfortable \nbuffer stock of foodgrains should keep food prices benign. The recently implemented \nGST rate rationalisation would lead to a reduction in prices of several items in the \nCPI basket. Overall, the inflation outcome is likely to be softer than what was \nprojected in the August MPC resolution, primarily on account of the GST rate cuts \nand benign food prices. Despite the anticipation of moderate momentum during H2, \nlarge unfavourable base effects are likely to exert upward pressure on headline CPI \ninflation, especially in Q4. Considering all these factors, CPI inflation for 2025-26 is \nnow projected at 2.6 per cent with Q2 at 1.8 per cent; Q3 at 1.8 per cent; and Q4 at \n4.0 per cent. CPI inflation for Q1:2026-27 is projected at 4.5 per cent (Chart 2). The \nrisks are evenly balanced. \n \n \n \nRationale for Monetary Policy Decisions \n \n12. The MPC observed that the overall inflation outlook has turned even more benign \nin the last few months, due to the reasons discussed above. The average headline \ninflation for 2025-26 is now revised lower from 3.7 per cent and 3.1 per cent \nprojected in June and August policy, respectively, to 2.6 per cent. Headline inflation \nfor Q4:2025-26 and Q1:2026-27 too have been revised downwards and are broadly \naligned with the target, despite unfavourable base effects. Core inflation for this year \nand Q1:2026-27 is also expected to remain contained. \n \n13. Growth outlook remains resilient supported by domestic drivers, despite weak \nexternal demand. It is likely to get further support from a favourable monsoon, lower \ninflation, monetary easing and the salubrious impact of recent GST reforms. \nHowever, growth continues to be below our aspirations. Even though the growth \nprojection for the financial year 2025-26 is being revised upwards, the forward-\nlooking projections for Q3 and beyond are expected to be slightly lower than \nprojected earlier, primarily due to tariff-related developments, despite being partially \noffset by the impetus provided by the rationalisation of GST rates. \n \n14. To summarize, there has been a significant moderation in inflation. Moreover, the \nprevailing global uncertainties and tariff related developments are likely to decelerate \ngrowth in H2:2025-26 and beyond. The current macroeconomic conditions and the \noutlook has opened up policy space for further supporting growth. However, the MPC \nnoted that the impact of the front-loaded monetary policy actions and the recent fiscal \nmeasures is still playing out. The trade related uncertainties are also unfolding. The \nMPC, therefore, considered it prudent to wait for the impact of policy actions to play \n4 \n \nout and greater clarity to emerge before charting the next course of action. \nAccordingly, the MPC unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at \n5.5 per cent. The MPC also decided to retain the stance at neutral. However, two \nmembers - Dr. Nagesh Kumar and Prof. Ram Singh, were of the view that the stance \nbe changed from neutral to accommodative. \n \n15. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on October 15, 2025. \n \n16. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during December 3 to 5, 2025. \n \nVoting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 5.5 per cent \n \nMember \nVote \nDr. Nagesh Kumar \nYes \nShri Saugata Bhattacharya \nYes \nProf. Ram Singh \nYes \nShri Indranil Bhattacharyya \nYes \nDr. Poonam Gupta \nYes \nShri Sanjay Malhotra \nYes \n \nStatement by Dr. Nagesh Kumar \n \n17. The external context for economic development has changed dramatically since \nthe August MPC. While the growth rate of 7.8% in the first quarter of the current fiscal \nyear was impressive, exceeding expectations, leading to an upward revision of \nprojections for the year, to 6.8% from 6.5%, it does not factor in the shock that India \nhas faced after the first quarter. Hence, the economic growth trajectory and projection \nsuffer from possible discontinuities. The acceleration in first-quarter growth has been \nunderpinned by consumption, especially rural consumption, and front-loading of \ngovernment capex. Private investment has continued to remain sluggish, despite \nhealthy growth of profits and profit margins, and capacity utilisation rates staying \nabove the 75% level, perhaps due to the trade policy uncertainties. Hence, there is \nno room for complacency as the future looks uncertain because of external shocks.  \n \n18. In particular, the Trump Administration has delivered a comprehensive assault on \nIndia with successive announcements over the past few weeks. Before we could \nabsorb the 25+25% reciprocal and penal tariffs on goods that became effective from \nthe end of August, a hefty $100,000 fee was imposed on H1B visas. There are also \nother measures, including the proposed HIRE Act on outsourcing, the 100% tax on \npatented pharmaceuticals, among others which may affect India\u2019s economic \nprospects. \n \n19. The trade policy measures adopted by the US, India\u2019s biggest trade partner and \nbiggest market for exports of goods and services, pose challenges for the economy. \nWhile the effect on the economic growth rate may be limited to between 40-60 bps, a \nlarger effect is expected on MSMEs and jobs. This is because the US is a much more \nimportant market for our labour-intensive goods than for all imports. The US accounts \nfor nearly 20% of India\u2019s merchandise exports, but our exposure to the US market is \nfar greater at 33% for labour-intensive goods such as textiles and garments, leather \ngoods, gems & jewellery, processed food products like shrimp. These are also the \nsectors that are dominated by MSMEs and account for a disproportionately larger \nshare (around 40%) of jobs in the manufacturing sector. Therefore, high penal tariffs \nimposed by the US on India have the prospect of affecting MSMEs and the jobs in a \nsignificant manner. \n \n5 \n \n20. In that context, diversification of export markets is the need of the hour, besides \nexploiting the domestic demand better. The Government has undertaken GST \nreforms that should help in charging the domestic consumption engine. \nDiversification of export markets beyond the US is also critical. In that context, the \nrecent signing of the UK-India FTA and the India-EFTA Economic and Trade \nAgreement that became effective on  October 1, 2025, are important developments. \nThe negotiations of the India-EU FTA have been expedited, and new ones have been \nplanned with the Eurasian Economic Community. We should also tap the potential of \nexisting FTAs with Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia and the UAE more \neffectively, for the export of labour-intensive goods, helping to reduce our \ndependence on the US market. We should also move up the value chain in these \nsectors by building and acquiring globally known brands, retail chains, and \ntechnological upgradation. \n \n21. On the monetary policy front, a pre-emptive action would be important to contain \nthe damage and to support private investments through liquidity provision, credit \nguarantees/ moratorium for MSMEs, including through a cut in the repo rate. \nFortunately, the inflationary expectations remain well-anchored, and the average \nheadline inflation has trended down, with projections for 2025-26 have now been \nrevised downwards to 2.6% from 3.7% in the June MPC meeting. The GST reforms \nare also likely to push it down further. Therefore, the benign inflation outlook opens \nup policy space for monetary action. However, we may wish to wait and watch as the \ntransmission of the existing actions is still unfolding and to see how the trade policy \nuncertainties play out before considering a rate cut at the December Meeting of the \nMPC. Nevertheless, we may like to signal the readiness of monetary policy to support \nthe industry, investments and growth by changing the stance from \u2018neutral\u2019 to \n\u2018accommodative.\u2019  \n \n22. Hence, I vote for keeping the repo rate unchanged at this juncture but feel that \nthe stance could be changed to accommodative.   \n \nStatement by Shri Saugata Bhattacharya \n \n23. Despite the continuing moderation in inflation opening up space for further \nmonetary policy easing, the arguments for a pause in my August 2025 statement \nremain materially the same.  \n \n24. Although domestic economic activity remains resilient, trade and tariff \nuncertainties remain a risk to growth and investment. The following line from the \nMPC resolution aptly summarises my position: \u201cThe impact of the frontloaded \nmonetary policy actions and the recent fiscal measures is still playing out. Trade \nrelated uncertainties are still unfolding. The MPC therefore considered it prudent to \nwait for the impact of policy actions to play out and greater clarity to emerge before \ncharting the next course of action.\u201d  \n \n25. A moderation in the inflation rate is not a compelling reason, at this point, to cut \nthe policy rate. The Monetary Policy Report forecasts an average FY27 inflation of \n4.5 per cent, with Q1 and Q2 FY27 also at 4.5% and Q3 at 5.1%. This is assuming a \nnormal monsoon and no exogenous shocks. In addition, real GDP growth in FY27 is \nprojected at a robust 6.6 per cent, following a forecast 6.8 per cent in FY26. The \nReport notes that \u201cdomestic economic activity remains resilient and is expected to \nmaintain momentum\u201d.  \n \n26. Domestic financial conditions remain easy, largely balanced. On bank credit, I \nshould also point to the recent study on banks\u2019 sanctions and disbursement pipeline \n6 \n \nin FY26. While loan sanctions in FY25 have moderated, total projected \ndisbursements in FY26 remain robust, with the remaining tranches in H2 expected to \nboost credit growth1.  \n \n27. The cumulative effects of the multiple, mutually reinforcing, policy stimulus \nmeasures \u2013 fiscal, monetary, financial and banking, trade, investment, regulations, \netc. \u2013 which have been progressively rolled out, need to be monitored.  \n \n28. It is also worth re-emphasising that monetary policy has to address multiple, often \nconflicting, objectives and optimise the consequent trade-offs. Given the economic \nconditions described above, at this juncture, I do not see the need for a policy easing.  \n \n29. Hence, taking into account the fluidity of the macro-financial environment, I vote \nfor a pause in monetary policy decision on the repo rate and for the same reason I \nbelieve that stance quo on the stance is appropriate at this point.  \n \nStatement by Prof. Ram Singh \n \n30. Since the last MPC meeting, the case for another rate cut in this cycle has \nbecome stronger. However, in view of the fiscal measures and the earlier monetary \neasing still working and the uncertainty on the external front looming large, I vote for \na pause in the policy repo rate. At the same time, I am in favour of a change in \nstance from \u201cneutral\u201d to \u201caccommodative\u201d. Below, I elaborate on my decisions.   \n \n31. CPI headline inflation has continued to surprise on the downside, as it declined to \n2.1 per cent (y-o-y) in August 2025 after registering its eight-year low of 1.6 per cent \nin July. The sharp decline in food inflation from its October 2024 peak has been \nconsistent and broad-based.  The available indicators and projections signal a \ncontinuation of the lower price momentum in food prices in the coming months. \nAccordingly, the CPI inflation for FY 2025-26 has been revised downward to 2.6 per \ncent, with Q3 at 1.8 per cent and Q4 at 4.0 per cent. \n \n32. Core inflation (excluding food and fuel) has also mainly remained contained in the \nrange of 4.1-4.4 per cent in the financial year so far. The print for Core inflation in \nAugust was 4.2 per cent - excluding precious metals, it was 3.0 per cent. \n \n33. The inflation trajectory looks benign at least for the next two quarters. Improved \ndomestic food supply chain logistics, a good kharif harvest, and above-normal water \nreservoirs bode well for low food inflation in the coming quarters. Crude prices are \nalso expected to remain stable, with a downward bias. The CPI inflation may exceed \nthe 4.0 per cent target in the next fiscal year, as the unfavourable base effect and the \nexpected boost in demand take hold. Core inflation is also expected to be elevated \nbut contained, as the base effect turns favourable following unusual increases in gold \nand silver prices over the last few months. \n  \n34. The GDP surprised on the upside, registering 7.8 per cent growth in Q1:2025-26 \n\u2013 GVA also grew by 7.6 per cent. For Q2, GDP growth also seems to be holding up \namid mixed signals from some high-frequency indicators.  \n \n35. The GDP growth projection for FY26 is now revised upwards to 6.8 per cent, \nfactoring in the unexpectedly high Q1 number along with the demand boost from \nmonetary easing and GST rationalisation. Still, compared to the MPC\u2019s February \n2025 growth forecast, the latest H2: 2025-26 growth projections have been revised \n \n1 \u201cPrivate Corporate Investment: Growth in 2024-25 and Outlook for 2025-26\u201d, RBI Monthly Bulletin, August 2025.  \n7 \n \ndownwards indicating some slack in momentum. In February, the forecast for Q3 and \nQ4 of FY 26 was 6.5 per cent each, whereas the latest growth forecasts are lower at \n6.4 per cent for Q3 and 6.2 per cent for Q4. Real GDP growth for Q1:2026-27 is \nprojected at 6.4 per cent. \n \n36. The prevailing inflation rate is too low - it is neither conducive for businesses nor \nfor public finances.  Besides, the downward revisions to the growth forecast of \nH2:2025-26, coming on the heels of a more benign inflationary outlook, make a case \nfor an additional growth-supportive interest rate cut. The case is further supported by \nthe adverse effects of US tariffs and the headwinds from a fluid geopolitical \nlandscape and heightened global uncertainties.  \n \n37. The next question to ponder over is what could be the downsides of a further rate \ncut. It may make more challenging for the banks to mobilise deposits to support credit \ngrowth.2 But what matters more is the total savings and the flow of funds to the real \nsector, and not just credit through the banking channel. An increasing share of \nsavings is being channeled to the private sector through bond and equity markets.3   \n \n38. The moderation in aggregate savings rates is a concern from a macroeconomic \nperspective.4 But interest rates do not seem to be the main driving force of the \naggregate saving rate.5 Research suggests that aggregate saving rates are driven by \nseveral factors, including demographic and other structural changes in the economy, \ndifferences in the rates of return on different forms of capital, and labour market \ndynamics, including the distribution of wages and income across economic strata. At \nthe household level, interest rates do matter. But their effects are more pronounced \non portfolio choices than on total savings.6 Thus, the likely adverse impact on bank \ndeposits and moderation in household savings should not be the reason for not going \nfor a further rate cut.  \n \n39. On the external front, the tariffs and financial market-related uncertainties have \npersisted over the last two quarters. It seems the forex market has already priced in \nthe worst in this regard. Though the exchange rate remains a concern, any pressure \non the INR is likely to be confined to the short term, given the robust fundamentals of \nthe Indian economy, including adequate forex reserves, a comfortable current \naccount position7,  and the centre\u2019s commitment to maintaining the fiscal glide path. \nThe inclusion of Indian bonds in global indices and improved prospects for gross and \nnet FDI are also a source of comfort.  \n \n40. Another concern is our interest rate differential with the U.S. and other major \neconomies. The rate cuts by the US Fed, the BoE and the ECB in recent months \nhave added some comfort on this count. Markets expects few more rates cuts by the \nUS Fed in 2025, which would be further comforting for interest rate differential.8  \n \n41. In sum, there is ample scope for an additional rate cut. The question is: Is there a \nneed for one during this policy cycle? \n \n2 The rate cut can adversely affect banks\u2019 NIMs and RoAs, ceteris paribus. However, the adverse effects will at least partly be \nmitigated by the 100 bps CRR cut and other regulatory easing measures for the banking sector.  \n3 According to the RBI data, the total flow of resources from non-bank sources to the commercial sector increased by \u20b92.66 lakh \ncrore in 2025-26 so far, more than offsetting the decline in non-food bank credit. \n4 India\u2019s gross domestic savings rate fell from 34.6% of GDP in 2011-12 to 30.7% in FY 24, with a slight uptick in FY25. \n5 During 2014-24, (excluding the two Covid years) while the policy rates have varied significantly in the range of 7.75%-5.50%, \nthe aggregate saving rates have fluctuated in the range of 29.6% to 32.2% \n6 The RBI\u2019s analysis of household savings a shift away from bank term deposits. The share of term deposits declined from \n50.54% in FY20 to 45.77% in FY25, due to households moving to alternative, higher-yielding investments like mutual funds and \nequities.  \n7 India\u2019s CAD moderated to 0.2 per cent of GDP in Q1:2025-26 as compared with 0.9 per cent of GDP in Q1:2024-25. For FY \n26, robust services exports and remittance receipts is expected to keep the CAD in the comfort zone. \n8 The S&P Global expects two 25-basis-point rate cuts by the Fed in calendar year 2025, in addition to the 25 pbs cut in \nSeptember. \n8 \n \n \n42. When the impact of the demand boost from the 100 bps cuts in repo rates this \nyear is yet to play out fully, a further rate cut today runs the risk of an overdose. The \nintended effects of the monetary easing and the fiscal measures are still working \nthrough the system.9 \n \n43. The risk aversion among investors seems to have eased, driven by a demand \nboost from the fiscal side (income tax reliefs and GST rationalisation), conducive \nfinancial conditions, broad-based transmission of rate cuts10, robust system-level \nfinancial parameters, and easing of micro and macroprudential regulations on banks. \nRecent signals on Private capex growth are encouraging.  Several indicators \ncorroborate this inference, such as an increased capacity utilisation11, significant \npickups in the flow of funds to the corporate sector through non-bank channels, \namong others.  \n \n44. Going forward, buoyancy in a broad range of service sectors and a resilient \nagriculture sector are supportive of growth momentum.  The demand is expected to \nget a further boost from the GST rationalisation and the festival season. Domestic \ndemand should continue to support fixed investment, amid continued monetary \ntransmission driven by adequate liquidity in the system and the remaining three \ntranches of CRR cuts. \n \n45. Under such conditions, the available scope for rates can be leveraged to sustain \nthe growth momentum for a longer period by extending the easing cycle. A change in \nstance to accommodative increases the odds of a rate cut in this easing cycle. \nBacked by conducive liquidity conditions and further improvement in transmission, it \nwill add to the income and demand effects induced by the 100 bps rate cuts so far. \nFurthermore, an expectation of a rate cut will likely put downward pressure on bond \nyields, thereby enhancing the appeal of the bond market for borrowers seeking to \nraise funds through market instruments. Yet, the accommodative stance gives the \nRBI flexibility to delay or hold back on further cuts in the event of unexpected \ndevelopments in food prices or on the external front. \n \n46. In view of the above, I vote to take a pause in the policy repo rate under the \nliquidity adjustment facility (LAF) at 5.50 per cent.  \n \n47. But I am in favour of changing the monetary policy stance from \u2018neutral\u2019 to \n\u201caccommodative\u201d.  \n \nStatement by Shri Indranil Bhattacharyya \n \n48. In a world characterised by geo-political strife, geo-economic fragmentation and \nstrategic realignment brought about by all-pervasive uncertainty on trade and tariffs, \nthe Indian economy has demonstrated strength and resilience. Based on buoyant \nservices sector activity and rebounding of the manufacturing sector, GDP growth \nregistered an impressive 7.8 per cent in Q1:2025-26, significantly higher than the \n \n9 According to RBI, in response to the cumulative policy repo rate cut of 100 bps in the current easing cycle (as of September \n29), the WACR, the 3-month T-bill rate, the 3-month CP issued by NBFCs, and the 3-month CD rate declined by 92 bps, 105 \nbps, 118 bps, and 147 bps, respectively. \n10 During February-August 2025, in response to the 100-basis points (bps) cut in the policy repo rate, the WALR of SCBs \nmoderated by 58 bps for fresh rupee loans; 71 bps is on account of interest rate effect. The moderation for outstanding rupee \nloans is to the extent of 55 bps. On the deposit side, the WADTDR on fresh deposits declined by 106 bps, while that on \noutstanding deposits softened by 22 bps over the same period. Transmission has been broad-based across sectors. The \nsystem-level financial parameters related to capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality and profitability of the SCBs continue to \nremain healthy. The system-level parameters of NBFCs too are sound, with improved GNPA ratios. \n11 Manufacturing PMI surged to a 17.5-year high of 59.3 in August 2025, along with strong business optimism. Services PMI \nreached a 15-year high of 62.9 in August. \n9 \n \nconsensus estimate.12 High-frequency indicators available so far suggest resilience \nin economic activity in Q2:2025-26; therefore, growth is likely to remain buoyant in \nQ2.  \n \n49. Looking ahead, growth in H2:2025-26 and beyond is likely to be determined by \nthe interplay of domestic tailwinds and external headwinds. Domestic demand is \nexpected to get a boost from growth supportive measures and policies such as GST \nrationalisation, income tax relief, past monetary policy actions and several regulatory \nmeasures announced by the Reserve Bank today. Benign inflation outlook and lower \nGST rates are also supportive of a revival in urban consumption demand. The spatial \nand temporal distribution of monsoon has generally been positive for agricultural \nactivity and rural demand. Along with congenial financial conditions, several growth-\nsupportive policies undertaken by the Government and the Reserve Bank should also \nbe a catalyst for a turnaround in private investment sentiments. However, tariff and \ntrade-related uncertainties would inhibit external demand, although it may get \npartially offset through higher consumption spending. Considering all these factors \nand the higher realised numbers for Q1, GDP growth for 2025-26 has now been \nrevised upwards from the August policy by 30 basis points.  \n \n50. In a span of 10 months, headline inflation moderated from 6.2 per cent in October \n2024 to 1.6 per cent in July 2025 before increasing to 2.1 per cent in August. This \nsharp disinflation was solely brought about by the precipitous decline in food inflation. \nThis unexpectedly swift moderation and its continuation over an extended period \nsuggests that the food inflation trajectory is likely to be more benign than what was \nanticipated earlier. Moreover, rationalisation of GST is likely to ease prices albeit in \nvarying degree depending on the extent of pass-through to the final consumer. \nCumulatively, these factors led to a downward revision in headline inflation forecast \nfor 2025-26 to 2.6 per cent, a cumulative revision of 110 basis points from the \nprojection of 3.7 per cent in June 2025. In terms of the quarterly forecast trajectory, \ninflation is expected to remain well below the target till Q3:2025-26 but progressively \nedge up thereafter. Therefore, the current ultra-low levels should be seen as a \ntransitory phenomenon, and monetary policy has to be cognisant of potential demand \npressures over the medium term generated by the cumulative impact of past \nmonetary and fiscal measures. At the same time, one needs to be wary of potential \nsupply shocks from weather related uncertainties as well as volatility in international \ncommodity prices.  \n \n51. Drawing from the above discussion, it can be inferred that the sharp moderation \nin inflation has undoubtedly opened up policy space for further rate easing. However, \nI vote to pause at the present juncture based on several considerations. These are (i) \ngiven the heightened uncertainty, a rate cut at this point may not have the intended \nimpact; (ii) allow for all past monetary and fiscal measures as well as the ensuing \nones (CRR reductions) to work its way through the financial system; and (iii) given no \nmarket expectation of a rate cut13, any rate reduction would surprise the market, \nwhich is detrimental in terms of policy credibility over the medium term.  \n \n52. Given the prevailing uncertainties, I also agree to continue with the neutral stance \nas it allows central banks to avoid committing to specific policy settings.14 A neutral \nstance provides the necessary flexibility to be nimble and agile in conducting two-way \nmarket operations consistent with evolving requirements. Any shift to an \naccommodative stance at this stage could be viewed as explicit forward guidance on \n \n12 Bloomberg poll of economists suggested a median growth forecast of 6.6 per cent in Q1 2025-26. \n13 As evident from the flat OIS rates. \n14 Agust\u00edn Carstens (2025). \u201cLessons learned and challenges ahead for central banks in the Americas\u201d speech delivered by \nGeneral Manager, Bank for International Settlements, at the BIS Chapultepec Conference, Mexico City, February 6.  \n \n10 \n \nthe future interest rate path, suggesting that it can only go down. Such precise \nguidance needs to be avoided since a neutral stance is not inconsistent with a rate \ncut. In this milieu, messaging has to be done with effective communication as errors \ncan be costly. In this context, it is worthwhile to remember the sagacious advice of a \nformer Fed Chairman \u201cMonetary policy may be 98% talk and only 2% action but cost \nof sending the wrong message can be high\u201d.15 \n \nStatement by Dr. Poonam Gupta  \n \n53. The Indian economy is proving to be resilient overall, well on its way to attain a \nhealthy growth rate in the ballpark of 6.5 to 7.0 per cent, both this year and the next. \nLower and steadier inflation has been another welcome enabler. Besides its inherent \nresilience on the back of robust domestic demand, a proactive policy response is \nadding strength to the economy to  withstand the challenges posed by a complex and \nfast evolving global policy environment. If it were not for the adverse global \nconditions, perhaps it would have already triggered a turnaround in the private \ninvestment cycle and further accelerated economic growth. \n \n54. In this context, the following developments that have occurred since the last \nmeeting of the MPC in August, weigh on this round of policy.  \n \n55. With the implementation of the rationalized GST rates since September 22, 2025, \nthe inflation outlook appears to be more benign. This along with the lesser food price \nbuild up has led the RBI to lower its current year inflation projection since the last \npolicy by 50 bps to 2.6 per cent. \n \n56. Simultaneously, the growth outlook has evolved too. Due to stronger than \nanticipated growth rate of 7.8 per cent for Q1:2025-26, and various indicators \npointing to a robust expansion in Q2:2025-26, growth  forecast for 2025-26 has been \nrevised upwards to 6.8 per cent. This subsumes the expected adverse effects of the \nUS tariffs, partly compensated by the likely growth inducing effects of GST \nrationalization.  \n \n57. As far as the economic outturns at quarterly and half yearly basis are concerned, \ngrowth is projected to be much higher in the first half relative to the second half of the \nfiscal year. Inflation, on the other hand, is projected to be more benign at 1.8 per cent \nduring Q2 and Q3 of this year and is expected to inch up to 4.0 per cent in Q4 and \n4.5 per cent in Q1 next year, as the unfavorable base effect kicks in. \n  \n58. The described growth-inflation mix, particularly slower growth in H2 and a benign \ninflation rate, has potentially opened some space for lowering the policy rates further; \nyet it is difficult for me to vote for a rate cut at this juncture.  \n \n59. This is for the following reasons. \n  \n60. First, while the recent measures announced by the government have significantly \nbolstered consumer sentiment, these measures are still working their way through. It \nwould be prudent for the impact of these measures to be sufficiently realized before \ntaking another supportive measure right away. Second, even the policy rate cuts \nannounced by the RBI during this calendar year are currently being transmitted \nthrough the system. Announcing a rate cut at this time may only be marginally \neffective. Third, the global uncertainties are evolving at a very fast pace. Depleting \n \n15 Benjamin.S. Bernanke (2015), Inaugurating a new blog, The Brookings Institution, Economic Studies. \n11 \n \npolicy ammunition at this point does not seem warranted until there is more clarity on \nhow the global policy environment will unfold henceforth. \n  \n61. Hence, I vote for the status quo, i.e., to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at \n5.5 per cent. \n \n62. While voting for a pause in the policy rate, I propose to retain the stance at \nneutral based on the following considerations.  \n \n63. Despite some space that has possibly opened up given the forward-looking \ngrowth-inflation dynamics, I feel changing the stance to accommodative is not \nrequired as the neutral stance does not prevent us from reducing the repo rate when \nwarranted.  \n \n64. Moreover, given the heightened global uncertainty, it may not be possible to \nconfidently commit to a new stance. Hence, I consider it prudent to retain the stance \nat neutral.  \n \nStatement by Shri Sanjay Malhotra \n \n65. The global economy has been resilient in the first half of 2025.  Frontloading of \nconsumption, inventory restocking, and delayed tariff implementation have supported \ngrowth. The outlook, however, remains subdued, with downside risks due to current \npolicy uncertainties and simmering geo-political tensions. Inflation is overshooting \ntarget in some countries while fiscal concerns remain elevated in advanced \neconomies. There is also downside risk from repricing of financial markets as equity \nmarkets remain buoyant amidst bearish sentiments on bonds (hardening yields). \n \n66. Domestic economic growth too was resilient in Q1:2025-26. High frequency \nindicators suggest that it is likely to remain strong in Q2. Thereafter, however, it is \nexpected to soften due to the impact of tariffs although the GST rationalisation would \npartially cushion the impact. Several indicators suggest that agricultural prospects are \nbright in the current year; consequently, rural demand is likely to be buoyant. Strong \nservices sector growth and steady employment conditions would support growth. \nExternal demand, however, is likely to remain lukewarm in the wake of prevailing \ntariff and trade-related uncertainties. On the whole, growth outcome for 2025-26 is \nnow expected to be higher at 6.8 per cent than 6.5 per cent envisaged in the August \npolicy, even as the outlook from H2 onwards is softer. \n \n67. Headline CPI inflation moderated to an eight-year low of 1.6 per cent in July \nbefore inching up to 2.1 per cent in August. The decline in inflation was primarily \ndriven by the food component due to improved supply conditions and measures \nundertaken by the government to manage the supply chain. Core (CPI excluding food \nand fuel) inflation remained contained at 4.2 per cent in August despite pressures \nfrom higher prices of gold and silver. In view of GST rationalisation and benign food \nprices, the projection of headline inflation for 2025-26 has now been lowered to 2.6 \nper cent from 3.1 per cent projected in the August policy and 3.7 per cent in June. \nThe outlook for inflation in Q1:2026-27 is also benign and has been revised \ndownwards. \n \n68. To summarise, even though growth is strong by current reckoning, its outlook is \nsofter and is expected to be below our aspirations.  The benign outlook for headline \nand core inflation as a result of the downward revision of projections opens up policy \nspace to further support growth. However, several growth-inducing policies unveiled \nby the Government and the Reserve Bank should help growth, going ahead. The \n12 \n \ncumulative impact of fiscal and monetary measures is yet to be realised fully. Tariff-\nrelated uncertainties are still evolving. There is elevated uncertainty on the external \nfront. In view of these factors, even though there is policy space to further cut the \npolicy rate, I feel this is not the opportune time for the same as it will not have the \ndesirable impact. Therefore, I vote to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 5.50 per \ncent. The intent of policy, nevertheless, is to continue to facilitate growth-enabling \nconditions. Some of the regulatory measures announced today will also be \nsupportive of this objective.  \n \n69. Moreover, I prefer to retain the neutral stance as any change to an \naccommodative stance at this stage, as suggested by some members, would \ntantamount to giving a definitive forward guidance about the future trajectory of the \npolicy rate. The policy uncertainty, rapidly evolving developments and the foggy \noutlook suggest that we exercise caution and take a view for each policy as per the \nthen prevailing macroeconomic conditions and outlook. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1317                                        Chief General Manager \n",
