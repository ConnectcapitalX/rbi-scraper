    "file_extracted_text": " \n February 02, 2026 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on Jilla Sahkari Bank Limited, Kanpur,  \nUttar Pradesh \n \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated January 30, 2026, \nimposed a monetary penalty of \u20b93 lakh (Rupees Three Lakh only) on the Jilla Sahkari \nBank Limited, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh (the bank) for non-compliance with certain \ndirections issued by RBI on \u2018Know Your Customer (KYC)\u2019. This penalty has been \nimposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section \n47A(1)(c) read with Sections 46(4)(i) and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by National Bank for \nAgriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) with reference to its financial position \nas on March 31, 2025. Based on supervisory findings of non-compliance with RBI \ndirections and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the bank \nadvising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure \nto comply with the said directions. After considering the bank\u2019s reply to the notice and \noral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the \nfollowing charge against the bank was sustained, warranting imposition of monetary \npenalty: \n \n     The bank had failed to put in place a system of periodic review of risk \ncategorisation of accounts, with such periodicity being at least once in six months. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n                    (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/2030                                           Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on \nRBI under Section 58G(1)(b) read with Section 58B(5)(aa) of the Reserve Bank of \nIndia Act, 1934. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the company was conducted by RBI with reference to \nits financial position as on March 31, 2024. Based on the supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice \nwas issued to the company advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be \nimposed on it for failure to comply with the said direction.  \n \n     After considering the company\u2019s reply to the notice, additional submissions made \nby it and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, \nthat the following charge against the company was sustained, warranting imposition \nof monetary penalty:  \n \n     The company failed to put in place any IT system / software for effective \nidentification and reporting of suspicious transactions. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \ncompany with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the company. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                  (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/2025                                         Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

After considering the \nbank\u2019s reply to the notice and additional submissions made by it, RBI found, inter \nalia, that the following charge against the bank was sustained, warranting imposition \nof monetary penalty: \n \nThe bank had sanctioned a loan to the relative of one of its directors. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered by the bank \nwith its customers. Further, imposition of monetary penalty is without prejudice to any \nother action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                      (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/2010                                             Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

Based on a comprehensive review of \nthe existing regulatory instructions, including the scope, coverage and prudential \nrequirements, the following draft Directions are being issued for public comments.  \n \ni) Commercial Banks - Relief Measures in areas affected by Natural Calamities \nii) Small Finance Banks - Relief Measures in areas affected by Natural Calamities \niii) Local Area Banks - Relief Measures in areas affected by Natural Calamities \niv) Urban Co-operative Banks - Relief Measures in areas affected by Natural \nCalamities \nv) Regional Rural Banks - Relief Measures in areas affected by Natural \nCalamities \nvi) Rural Co-operative Banks - Relief Measures in areas affected by Natural \nCalamities \nvii) Non-Banking Financial Companies - Relief Measures in areas affected by \nNatural Calamities \nviii) All India Financial Institutions - Relief Measures in areas affected by Natural \nCalamities \n \n2.

The guidelines envisage a principle-based resolution regime, providing \ncomplete discretion to the RE with respect to design and implementation of \nresolution plan, inter alia taking into consideration the decisions of the State \nLevel Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC) / District Consultative Committee (DCC). \nii. The exposures which have been affected by the natural calamity and which \nare \u2018Standard\u2019 but in default up to 30 days i.e., \u2018SMA-0\u2019 on the date of \noccurrence of the natural calamity, shall be eligible to be considered for relief \nunder the guidelines. \niii. To ensure timely implementation of relief measures, a dedicated window has \nbeen prescribed for invocation of the resolution framework along with a \nseparate window for implementation of Resolution Plan (RP), post invocation.  \niv. Exposures restructured as part of relief measures shall continue to be \nclassified as \u2018Standard\u2019 with income recognition on accrual basis, with reduced \nadditional specific provisioning vis-\u00e0-vis other restructured exposures.  \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \nv.

    "file_extracted_text": " \nJanuary 23, 2026 \n \nState Finances: A Study of Budgets of 2025-26 \n \n \n     Today, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released the Report \u2018State Finances: A \nStudy of Budgets of 2025-26\u2019. The theme of this year\u2019s Report is \u2018Demographic \nTransition in India - Implications for State Finances\u2019. It provides a comprehensive \nassessment of the finances of State governments for 2025-26 against the backdrop of \nactual and revised/provisional accounts for 2023-24 and 2024-25, respectively.  \n \nHighlights: \n \ni. States\u2019 consolidated gross fiscal deficit increased to 3.3 per cent of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) in 2024-25, after remaining below 3.0 per cent during the previous \nthree years. The deficit exceeding 3 per cent mainly reflects 50-year interest free \nloans from the Centre under Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment, \nwhich is over and above the normal net borrowing ceiling of the States. In 2025-\n26, States have budgeted a gross fiscal deficit of 3.3 per cent of GDP.  \nii. The thrust on capital expenditure was sustained as capital expenditure remained \nsteady at 2.7 per cent of GDP in 2023-24 and 2024-25 and is budgeted at 3.2 per \ncent of GDP in 2025-26.  \niii. The consolidated outstanding liabilities of States remained elevated in the post-\npandemic period with a budget estimate of 29.2 per cent of GDP at end-March \n2026.  \niv. Indian States are at different stages of demographic transition, which increasingly \nshape their finances. Youthful States have a wider window of opportunity due to \nan expanding working-age population and stronger revenue mobilisation, which \ncan be harnessed through higher investment in human capital. In contrast, ageing \nStates face a narrowing window, with fiscal pressures arising from shrinking tax \nbases and rising committed expenditure, calling for higher revenue capacity and \nreforms in healthcare, pensions and workforce policies. Intermediate States need \nto balance growth priorities with early preparation for ageing. \n \n     This publication has been prepared in the Division of State Finances in the \nDepartment of Economic and Policy Research. The current issue, along with past \nissues of the Report, are available on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website (www.rbi.org.in). \nComments on this publication can be sent to the Director, Division of State Finances, \nDepartment of Economic and Policy Research, Amar Building (6th Floor), Reserve \nBank of India, Sir Pherozshah Mehta Road, Mumbai - 400 001.
