The information on face value and market value of \nunits held by non-residents, unit premium reserve, other foreign liabilities and assets \nof MFs as at end of the financial year were collected under the survey. The external \nassets and liabilities of their AMCs were taken from the annual census on foreign \nliabilities and assets (FLA) of direct investment companies for the reference period \n2024-25. \n \nHighlights: \n \nI. Mutual Funds (MFs): \n\u2022 Foreign liabilities of MFs increased by 19.9 per cent during 2024-25 to                      \nUS$ 30.5 billion (at market value) in March 2025, due to the rise in units \nissued to non-residents (Table 1). \n\u2022 Overseas assets of MFs declined by 5.6 per cent and stood at US$ 8.3 \nbillion in March 2025, due to lower holdings of foreign equity securities.  \n\u2022 As a result, the net foreign liabilities of MFs increased to US$ 22.2 billion in \nMarch 2025 from US$ 16.6 billion a year ago.  \n\u2022 Non-residents of United Arab Emirates (UAE), the United States of \nAmerica (USA), the United Kingdom (UK) and Singapore held the largest \nshare in MF units, both in terms of face value as well as at market value \n(Tables 2 and 3).  \n\u2022 Over 95 per cent of the overseas equity investment of the MFs were \nconcentrated in the USA, Luxembourg, and Ireland (Table 4). \n \nII. Asset Management Companies (AMCs): \n\u2022 Foreign liabilities of AMCs increased by 16.8 per cent and stood at                      \nUS$ 7.5 billion in March 2025, on the back of higher inward direct \ninvestments (Table 5). \n\u2022 Residents in Japan, Canada and the UK together accounted for over 83 \nper cent of FDI among Indian AMCs (Table 6). \n\u2022 The overseas assets of AMCs increased marginally from their previous \nyear\u2019s level and were largely held in Guernsey, Singapore and Mauritius \n(Table 7).  \n \n \n                 (Puneet Pancholy)  \nPress Release: 2025-2026/926                                                 Chief General Manager \n \n1 The results of the previous survey round for the year 2023-24 were released vide press release dated August 13, 2024. \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n \n \nTable 1: Mutual Funds \u2013 Foreign Liabilities and Assets \n \nItem \nEnd-March 2024 (R) \nEnd-March 2025 (P) \n\u20b9 crore \nUS$ \nmillion \n\u20b9 crore \nUS$ \nmillion \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \nForeign Liabilities \n2,12,120 \n25,442 \n2,61,057 \n30,504 \n      (a) Market Value of Units \n2,11,747 \n25,397 \n2,60,546 \n30,444 \n      (b) Other Foreign Liabilities \n373 \n45 \n511 \n60 \nForeign Assets \n73,518 \n8,818 \n71,265 \n8,328 \n     (a) Equity Securities \n71,095 \n8,527 \n69,086 \n8,073 \n     (b) Debt Securities \n- \n- \n- \n- \n     (c) Other Foreign Assets \n2,423 \n291 \n2,179 \n255 \nNet Liabilities \n1,38,602 \n16,624 \n1,89,792 \n22,176 \n  \nForeign Liabilities in Units at Face Value \n49,777 \n5,970 \n63,112 \n7,374 \nNotes: \n1.

    "file_extracted_text": " \nAugust 14, 2025 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on Maharashtra Gramin Bank, Aurangabad \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated August 12, 2025, \nimposed a monetary penalty of \u20b94.20 lakh (Rupees Four Lakh Twenty Thousand \nonly) on Maharashtra Gramin Bank, Aurangabad (the bank) for non-compliance with \ncertain directions issued by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development \n(NABARD) on \u2018Offsite Surveillance System \u2013 Revision of Due dates for Submission \nof OSS/FMS Returns\u2019 and certain directions issued by RBI on \u2018Know Your Customer \n(KYC)\u2019. This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under \nthe provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read with Sections 46(4)(i) and 51(1) of the \nBanking Regulation Act. \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by NABARD with reference to \nits financial position as on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with NABARD and RBI directions and related correspondence in that \nregard, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty \nshould not be imposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After \nconsidering the bank\u2019s reply to the notice and oral submissions made during the \npersonal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charges against the bank \nwere sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: \nThe bank had: \ni) \nreported certain frauds to NABARD with delay; and  \nii) \nfailed to put in place a system of periodic review of risk categorisation of \naccounts, with such periodicity being at least once in six months. \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers. Further, imposition of monetary penalty is without prejudice \nto any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n              (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/910                                               Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

The market participants can bid in the switch auction through the Switch Transaction module \nprovided in the e-Kuber portal. \nBidding in a switch transaction \n2. Bidding in the auction implies that the market participants agree to sell the source \nsecurity/ies to the Government of India (GoI) and simultaneously agree to buy the destination \nsecurity from the GoI at their respective quoted prices. \nPlacing of bids \n3. Each bid should specify the following details: \nI. \nAmount of the source security (Face Value) that the participants are willing to sell. \nII. \nPrice of the source security (expressed up to two decimal places). \nIII. \nChoice of destination security and the price of the destination security (expressed up \nto two decimal places), at which the participants are willing to buy the destination \nsecurity. \n4. The participants can choose to bid for any/all the destination security/ies, but the aggregate \namount of bids for the source security should not exceed their holdings of the source security \nin face value terms.  \nMinimum Bid size \n5. Minimum bid size would be \u20b910,000 and in multiples of \u20b910,000 thereafter. The participants \nare allowed to submit multiple bids. However, the aggregate amount of bids submitted should \nnot exceed the notified amount of source security/basket of source securities in the auction.  \nPrice of source security \n6. The price of the source security quoted must be equal to the FBIL closing price of the \nsource security as on the previous working day. \n7. Bids for source security not as per the price mentioned above will be rejected.  \nPrice of destination security \n8. Bids for the destination security may be placed after taking into account the price of source \nsecurity as mentioned above.  \nMethod of auction \n9. The auction will be a multiple-price based auction, i.e. successful bids will get accepted at \ntheir respective quoted prices for the source and destination securities. \nAuction decision \n10. The auction cut-off will be decided based on the price of the destination security/ies. \n11. Successful bidders are those who have placed their bids at or above the cut-off price. All \nbids lower than the cut-off price will be rejected. \n12. There will be provision of pro-rata allotment, should there be more than one successful bid \nat the cut-off price.  \nAmount of destination security and dealing in odd amounts during switch auction \n13. The switch ratio, which is the ratio of the price of the source security to the price of the \ndestination security, would be rounded off at 8 decimal places. \n14. The amount of destination security to be issued for each successful bid will be computed \nby multiplying the allotted amount (FV) of the source security with the rounded-off switch ratio. \nThe amount of destination security (FV) would be rounded-off to the nearest lower value in \nmultiples of \u20b910,000.  \n15. The odd amount of destination securities (less than \u20b910,000) which has been rounded-off, \nwould be notionally allotted and bought back from the bidders at the quoted bid price of the \ndestination security. The net cash consideration to be paid to the bidder for such odd amounts \nwould be the clean price of these securities (as the accrued interest received during notional \nallotment and paid during notional buyback offset each other). \nFund settlement \n16. Though the conversion would be broadly cash neutral, there will be fund settlement for the \nnet accrued interest (accrued interest for the source security FV \u2013 accrued interest for the \ndestination security FV) for each bid. Cash consideration (due to rounding-off of face value of \ndestination security) computed for each bid would be added to the net accrued interest. \nAccordingly, fund settlement will be done for the final amount (Net accrued interest + cash \nconsideration) for each bid. \nNote: An illustration for the calculation of cash consideration due to rounding-off of \ndestination security face value is as given below: \nAmount of Source Security (FV) \n\u20b910,00,00,000.00 \nPrice of Source Security  \n\u20b997.50 \nPrice of Destination Security  \n\u20b999.20 \nSwitch Ratio (rounded-off at 8 decimals) \n0.98286290 \nDestination Security FV before rounding off  \n\u20b99,82,86,290.00 \nDestination Security FV re-issued after rounding-off  \n\u20b99,82,80,000.00 \nOdd amount of rounded-off destination security (FV) \n\u20b96290.00 \nCash consideration due to rounding off (Clean Price \ncalculated at the quoted price of destination security) \n\u20b96240.00 \n17. The settlement of the auction would be held on T+1 basis. \nHelp Desk \n18.

    "file_extracted_text": " \n August 11, 2025 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on The Utkal Cooperative Bank Limited, \nBhubaneswar \n \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated August 05, 2025, \nimposed a monetary penalty of \u20b92.53 lakh (Rupees Two Lakh Fifty Three Thousand \nonly) on The Utkal Cooperative Bank Limited, Bhubaneswar (the bank) for non-\ncompliance with specific directions issued by RBI under \u2018Supervisory Action \nFramework (SAF)\u2019 and certain directions issued on \u2018Membership of Credit Information \nCompanies (CICs) by Co-operative Banks\u2019 and \u2018Know Your Customer (KYC)\u2019. This \npenalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under provisions \nof Section 47A(1)(c) read with Sections 46(4)(i) and 56 of the Banking Regulation \nAct, 1949 and Section 25 read with Section 23 of the Credit Information Companies \n(Regulation) Act, 2005.   \n \n    The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by the RBI with reference to its \nfinancial position as on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice \nwas issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be \nimposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the \nbank\u2019s reply to the notice and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, \nRBI found, inter alia, that the following charges against the bank were sustained, \nwarranting imposition of monetary penalty:  \n \nThe bank had: \ni) incurred capital expenditure without prior approval of RBI in non-adherence to \ndirections under SAF; \nii) failed to submit credit information of customers to three Credit Information \nCompanies; \niii) failed to upload the KYC records of customers onto Central KYC Records \nRegistry (CKYCR); and \niv) failed to put in place a system of periodic review of risk categorisation of \naccounts with such periodicity being at least once in six months. \n \n     This action is based on deficiency in regulatory compliance and is not intended to \npronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank \nwith its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without prejudice to \nany other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n               (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/882                                               Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
