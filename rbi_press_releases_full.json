This \npenalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under the \nprovisions of Section 58G(1)(b) read with Section 58B(5)(aa) of the Reserve Bank of \nIndia Act, 1934. \n  \n     The scrutiny of the company with regard to its digital lending operations was \nconducted by RBI. Based on supervisory findings of non-compliance with RBI \ndirections and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the \ncompany advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for \nits failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the company\u2019s reply to \nthe notice and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter \nalia, that the following charge against the company was sustained, warranting \nimposition of monetary penalty: \n \nThe company had obtained a Default Loss Guarantee from Lending Service Provider, \nwhich exceeded five per cent of the amount of outstanding loan portfolio. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \ncompany with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the company. \n \n \n \n \n \n                    (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1884                                          Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

The survey is for the reference \nperiod October \u2013 December 2025 (Q3:2025-26).  \n \n     The Reserve Bank has been conducting the Order Books, Inventories and Capacity \nUtilisation Survey (OBICUS) of the manufacturing sector on a quarterly basis since 2008. \nThe information collected in the survey includes quantitative data on new orders received \nduring the reference quarter, backlog of orders at the beginning of the quarter, pending \norders at the end of the quarter, total inventories with a breakup between \ufb01nished goods \n(FG), work-in-progress (WiP) and raw material (RM) inventories at the end of the quarter, \nitem-wise production in terms of quantity and value during the quarter vis-\u00e0-vis the \ninstalled capacity from the targeted group and the reasons for changes in production / \ninstalled capacity during the quarter. The level of capacity utilisation (CU) is estimated \nfrom these responses. The survey provides valuable input for monetary policy \nformulation. The survey findings are released on the website of the Bank regularly. \n \n     During this quarter, selected manufacturing companies will be approached by the \nBank. Other manufacturing companies may also participate in the survey by downloading \nthe survey questionnaire from the Reserve Bank\u2019s website https://www.rbi.org.in. The \nsurvey questionnaire is placed under the head \u2018Forms\u2019 (available under the \u2018More Links\u2019 \nat the bottom of the home page) and sub-head \u2018Survey\u2019.

    "file_extracted_text": " \n January 05, 2026 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on Jila Sahakari Bank Limited, Mau,  \nUttar Pradesh \n \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated December 31, 2025, \nimposed a monetary penalty of \u20b92 lakh (Rupees Two Lakh only) on Jila Sahakari \nBank Limited, Mau, Uttar Pradesh (the bank) for non-compliance with certain \ndirections issued by RBI on \u2018Know Your Customer (KYC)\u2019. This penalty has been \nimposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section \n47A(1)(c) read with Sections 46(4)(i) and 56 of BR Act. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by National Bank for \nAgriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) with reference to its financial position \nas on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-compliance with RBI \ndirections and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the bank \nadvising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure \nto comply with the said directions. After considering the bank\u2019s reply to the notice and \noral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the \nfollowing charges against the bank were sustained, warranting imposition of monetary \npenalty: \n \nThe bank had failed to:  \ni. \nput in place a system of periodic review of risk categorisation of accounts, \nwith such periodicity being at least once in six months; and \nii. \ncarry out periodic updation of KYC of its customers. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n                    (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1846                                           Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
