This penalty has been imposed in \nexercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read \nwith Sections 46(4)(i) and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and Section 25 \nread with Section 23 of the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by Reserve Bank of India with \nreference to its financial position as on March 31, 2025. Based on supervisory \nfindings of non-compliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that \nregard, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty \nshould not be imposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After \nconsidering the bank\u2019s reply to the notice and oral submissions made during the \npersonal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charges against the bank \nwere sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: \n  \nThe bank had:  \ni. \nincurred capital expenditure without prior approval of RBI in non-adherence to \ndirections under SAF; and \nii. \nfailed to submit credit information of its customers to all the four Credit \nInformation Companies. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                    (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1685                                         Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

The market participants can bid in the switch auction through the Switch Transaction \nmodule provided in the e-Kuber portal. \nBidding in a switch transaction \n2. Bidding in the auction implies that the market participants agree to sell the source \nsecurity/ies to the Government of India (GoI) and simultaneously agree to buy the destination \nsecurity from the GoI at their respective quoted prices. \nPlacing of bids \n3. Each bid should specify the following details: \nI. \nAmount of the source security (Face Value) that the participants are willing to sell. \nII. \nPrice of the source security (expressed up to two decimal places). \nIII. \nChoice of destination security and the price of the destination security (expressed up \nto two decimal places), at which the participants are willing to buy the destination \nsecurity. \n4. The participants can choose to bid for any/all the destination security/ies, but the aggregate \namount of bids for the source security should not exceed their holdings of the source security \nin face value terms.   \nMinimum Bid size \n5. Minimum bid size would be \u20b910,000 and in multiples of \u20b910,000 thereafter. The participants \nare allowed to submit multiple bids. However, the aggregate amount of bids submitted should \nnot exceed the notified amount of source security/basket of source securities in the auction.  \nPrice of source security \n6. The price of the source security quoted must be equal to the FBIL closing price of the \nsource security as on the previous working day. \n7. Bids for source security not as per the price mentioned above will be rejected.  \nPrice of destination security \n8. Bids for the destination security may be placed after taking into account the price of source \nsecurity as mentioned above.  \nMethod of auction \n9. The auction will be a multiple-price based auction, i.e. successful bids will get accepted at \ntheir respective quoted prices for the source and destination securities. \nAuction decision \n10. The auction cut-off will be decided based on the price of the destination security/ies. \n11. Successful bidders are those who have placed their bids at or above the cut-off price. All \nbids lower than the cut-off price will be rejected. \n12. There will be provision of pro-rata allotment, should there be more than one successful bid \nat the cut-off price.  \n \nAmount of destination security and dealing in odd amounts during switch auction \n13. The switch ratio, which is the ratio of the price of the source security to the price of the \ndestination security, would be rounded off at 8 decimal places. \n14. The amount of destination security to be issued for each successful bid will be computed \nby multiplying the allotted amount (FV) of the source security with the rounded-off switch ratio. \nThe amount of destination security (FV) would be rounded-off to the nearest lower value in \nmultiples of \u20b910,000.  \n15. The odd amount of destination securities (less than \u20b910,000) which has been rounded-off, \nwould be notionally allotted and bought back from the bidders at the quoted bid price of the \ndestination security. The net cash consideration to be paid to the bidder for such odd amounts \nwould be the clean price of these securities (as the accrued interest received during notional \nallotment and paid during notional buyback offset each other). \nFund settlement \n16. Though the conversion would be broadly cash neutral, there will be fund settlement for the \nnet accrued interest (accrued interest for the source security FV \u2013 accrued interest for the \ndestination security FV) for each bid. Cash consideration (due to rounding-off of face value of \ndestination security) computed for each bid would be added to the net accrued interest.  \nAccordingly, fund settlement will be done for the final amount (Net accrued interest + cash \nconsideration) for each bid. \nNote: An illustration for the calculation of cash consideration due to rounding-off of \ndestination security face value is as given below: \nAmount of Source Security (FV) \n\u20b910,00,00,000.00 \nPrice of Source Security  \n\u20b997.50 \nPrice of Destination Security  \n\u20b999.20 \nSwitch Ratio (rounded-off at 8 decimals) \n0.98286290 \nDestination Security FV before rounding off  \n\u20b99,82,86,290.00 \nDestination Security FV re-issued after rounding-off  \n\u20b99,82,80,000.00 \nOdd amount of rounded-off destination security (FV) \n\u20b96290.00 \nCash consideration due to rounding off (Clean Price \ncalculated at the quoted price of destination security) \n\u20b96240.00 \n17. The settlement of the auction would be held on T+1 basis. \nHelp Desk \n18.
