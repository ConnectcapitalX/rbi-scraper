This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred \non RBI under the provisions of Section 30(1) read with Section 26(6) of the Payment \nand Settlement Systems Act, 2007. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the company was conducted by RBI with reference to \nits operations for the period from October 2023 to December 2024. Based on \nsupervisory \nfindings \nof \nnon-compliance \nwith \nRBI \ndirections \nand \nrelated \ncorrespondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the company advising it to \nshow cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure to comply \nwith the said directions.  \n \n     After considering the company\u2019s reply to the notice, additional submissions made \nby it and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, \nthat the following charge against the company was sustained, warranting imposition \nof monetary penalty:  \n \n     The end of the day balance in the escrow account of the company was less than \nthe value of outstanding PPls and payments due to merchants on certain days and \nthe company did not report shortfall in the said escrow account to RBI immediately. \n  \n     The action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \ncompany with its customers. Further, imposition of monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the company.  \n \n \n \n \n \n              (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1094                                             Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
