The survey2 collects details on India\u2019s exports of software services {computer \nservices and ITES/business process outsourcing (BPO) services} as per type of activity, \non-site/off-site nature of services, country of destination and modes of supply. \n  \nFor 2024-25 round of the survey, 6,766 software export companies were contacted, of \nwhich 2,206 companies, including most of the large companies, responded. The \nparticipating companies together accounted around 90 per cent of total software services \nexports3 (Table 1). \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 Exports of software services by the Indian companies (excluding their sales \nthrough overseas commercial presence) are estimated to have increased by 7.3 \nper cent during 2024-25 to US$ 204.7 billion (Table 2). \n \n\u2022 Computer services continued to account for over two-thirds of India\u2019s total \nsoftware services exports during the year; BPO services remained the major \ncomponent of ITES exports (Tables 2 and 3). \n \n\u2022 While private limited companies recorded a growth of 11.6 per cent in the total \nexport of software services during the year, exports by public limited companies \nincreased marginally by 1.3 per cent (Table 4). \n \n\u2022 Software exports to the United States of America (USA) increased at a lower pace \nof 4.9 per cent compared to 14.3 per cent growth for Europe. As a result, the share \nof USA in total software exports declined from 54.1 per cent during 2023-24 to \n52.9 per cent during 2024-25.

Further, Myanmar was added \nto the list of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action in the October 2022 FATF \nplenary and FATF has called on its members and other jurisdictions to apply enhanced \ndue diligence measures proportionate to the risk arising from Myanmar. When applying \nenhanced due diligence measures, countries have been advised to ensure that flows of \nfunds for humanitarian assistance, legitimate NPO activity and remittances are not \ndisrupted. The status of Myanmar in the list of countries subject to a call for action, \nremains unchanged. \n  \n     FATF had earlier identified the following jurisdictions as having strategic deficiencies \nin their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation \nfinancing and had placed the jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring, which had \ndeveloped action plan with the FATF to deal with them. These jurisdictions were:  \nAlgeria, Angola, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, Haiti, Kenya, Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), \nLebanon, Monaco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, South Sudan, \nSyria, Venezuela, Vietnam, Virgin Islands (UK) and Yemen. As per the October 24, 2025 \nFATF public statement Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa have been \nremoved from this list based on review by the FATF. \n \n     FATF plenary releases documents titled \u201cHigh-Risk jurisdictions subject to a Call for \nAction\u201d and \u201cJurisdictions under Increased Monitoring\u201d with respect to jurisdictions that \nhave strategic AML/CFT deficiencies as part of the ongoing efforts to identify and work \nwith jurisdictions with strategic Anti-Money Laundering (AML)/Combating of Financing of \nTerrorism (CFT) deficiencies. This advice does not preclude the regulated entities from \nlegitimate trade and business transactions with these countries and jurisdictions \nmentioned there.  \n     The detailed information is available in the updated public statements and document \nreleased by FATF on October 24, 2025.

The objectives of the \nFATF are to set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory \nand operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and \nother related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. The FATF \nmonitors the progress of its members in implementing necessary measures, reviews \nmoney laundering and terrorist financing techniques and counter-measures, and \npromotes the adoption and implementation of appropriate measures globally. The \nFATF's decision making body, the FATF Plenary, meets three times a year and \nupdates these statements, which may be noted. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                Ajit Prasad \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1443                                                Deputy General Manager  \n                                                                                                     (Communications)                     \n \n \n",

This penalty has been imposed in \nexercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read \nwith Sections 46(4)(i) and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.  \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by RBI with reference to its \nfinancial position as on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice \nwas issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be \nimposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions.  \n \n     After considering the bank\u2019s reply to the notice, oral submissions made during the \npersonal hearing and additional submissions made by it, RBI found that the following \ncharge against the bank was sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty:  \n \n     The bank did not classify credit facilities of certain borrowers as non-performing \nassets (NPAs). \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                     (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1418                                            Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
