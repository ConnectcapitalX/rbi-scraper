This penalty has been imposed in exercise \nof powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read with \nSection 46(4)(i) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. \n \n     The Statutory Inspection for Supervisory Evaluation (ISE 2024) of the bank was \nconducted by RBI with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2024. \nBased on supervisory findings of non-compliance with RBI directions and related \ncorrespondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show \ncause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure to comply with the \nsaid directions.  \n \n     After considering the bank\u2019s reply to the notice, additional submissions made by it \nand oral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found that the following \ncharges against the bank were sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty:  \n \ni) The bank did not carry out valuation of properties by independent valuers in \ncertain mortgage loans. \nii) The bank opened / maintained certain current accounts in contravention of \nextant regulatory requirements.  \n \n     The action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers. Further, imposition of monetary penalty is without prejudice \nto any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/873                                               Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

Patan, Gujarat \n \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBl) has, by an order dated July 31, 2025, imposed a \nmonetary penalty of \u20b91 lakh (Rupees One Lakh only) on The Chanasma Nagrik \nSahakari Bank Limited, Chanasma, Dist. Patan, Gujarat (the bank) for non-\ncompliance with certain directions issued by RBI on \u2018Customer Protection - Limiting \nLiability of Customers of Co-operative Banks in Unauthorised Electronic Banking \nTransactions\u2019. This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on \nRBI under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read with Sections 46(4)(i) and 56 of \nthe Banking Regulation Act, 1949. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by RBI with reference to its \nfinancial position as on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice \nwas issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be \nimposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the \nbank's reply to the notice and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, \nRBI found, inter alia, that the following charges against the bank were sustained, \nwarranting imposition of monetary penalty: \n \nThe bank failed to:  \ni. provide customers with 24x7 access to report unauthorised electronic banking \ntransactions through multiple channels; and  \nii. enable its customers to instantly respond by \"Reply\" to the SMS alerts to notify \nthe objection towards unauthorised electronic banking transactions, if any.  \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            (Puneet Pancholy)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/857                                             Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

Regulation \n \n1. \nStandardisation of procedure for settlement of claims in respect of \ndeposit accounts of deceased customers of banks \n \n     Under the provisions of Banking Regulation Act, 1949, nomination facility is \navailable in respect of deposit accounts, articles kept in safe custody or safe deposit \nlockers. This is intended to facilitate expeditious settlement of claims or return of \narticles or release of contents of safe deposit locker upon death of a customer and to \nminimise hardship caused to family members. The extant instructions require banks \nto adopt a simplified procedure to facilitate expeditious and hassle-free settlement of \nclaims made by survivors/ nominees/ legal heirs, the procedures vary across banks. \nWith a view to enhance customer service standards, it has been decided to streamline \nthe procedures and standardise the documentation to be submitted to the banks. A \ndraft circular in this regard shall be issued shortly for public consultation. \n \nII. Financial Markets \n2. \nIntroduction of Auto-bidding facilities in RBI Retail Direct for Investment \nand Re-investment in T-bills  \n \n     The Retail Direct portal was launched in November 2021 to facilitate retail investors \nto open their Gilt accounts with the Reserve Bank under the Retail Direct Scheme. \nThe scheme allows retail investors to buy Government Securities (G-Secs) in primary \nauctions as well as buy and sell G-Secs in the secondary market. Since the launch of \nthe Scheme, various new features, in terms of product as well as payment options, \nhave been introduced, including launch of a mobile app in May 2024. \n \n     To enable investors to systematically plan their investments, an auto-bidding facility \nfor Treasury bills (T-bills), covering both investment and re-investment options, has \nbeen enabled in Retail Direct. The new functionality helps investors to mandate \nautomatic placement of bids in primary auctions of T-bills.   \n \n(Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/843                                               Chief General Manager \n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n  \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n  \u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u036a\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0223\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0223\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u0367\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

    "file_extracted_text": "1 \n \n \nAugust 06, 2025 \nGovernor\u2019s Statement: August 6, 2025 \n     Namaskar and greetings to all in this month of Raksha Bandhan, Independence \nDay, Janmashtami, Parsi New Year and Ganesh Chaturthi. May this pious and \nauspicious month bring good luck to all of us and to our economy. \n     The monsoon season has been progressing well. We are also approaching the \nfestival season, which typically brings greater enthusiasm and buoyancy in economic \nactivity. This favourable domestic setting, together with supportive policies of the \nGovernment and the Reserve Bank, augurs well for the Indian economy in the near \nterm, as geopolitical uncertainties have somewhat abated, even though global trade \nchallenges continue to linger. Over the medium-term also, the Indian economy holds \nbright prospects in the changing world order drawing on its inherent strength, robust \nfundamentals, and comfortable buffers. Opportunities are there for the taking, and we \nare making all efforts to create enabling conditions through a multi-pronged yet \ncohesive approach to policymaking. \n2. \nGlobally, policy makers are faced with muted growth and slowing pace of \ndisinflation, with some advanced economies even witnessing an uptick in inflation. As \nthe dust settles and a new equilibrium emerges in the new global order, policymakers \nwill have a tough task navigating a world characterised by modest growth, sticky \ninflation and elevated public debt levels.  \n3. \nAt the Reserve Bank, leveraging on the room provided by a significant \nmoderation in inflation, we have taken decisive and forward-looking measures to \nsupport growth. The coordinated use of various tools available to us has helped \naccelerate monetary policy transmission in the current easing cycle.   \nDecisions of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) \n4. \nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 4th, 5th and 6th of August to \ndeliberate and decide on the policy repo rate. After a detailed assessment of the \nevolving macroeconomic and financial developments and the outlook, the MPC voted \nunanimously to keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) \nunchanged at 5.50 per cent; consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate \nshall remain unchanged at 5.25 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate \nand the Bank Rate at 5.75 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the neutral \nstance.  \n5. \nThe MPC noted that, while headline inflation is much lower than projected \nearlier, it is mainly due to volatile food prices, especially of vegetables. Core inflation, \non the other hand, has remained steady around the 4 per cent mark, as anticipated. \nInflation is projected to go up from the last quarter of this financial year. Growth is \nrobust and as per earlier projections though below our aspirations. The uncertainties \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \nof tariffs are still evolving. Monetary policy transmission is continuing. The impact of \nthe 100 bps rate cut since February 2025 on the economy is still unfolding. \n6. \nOn balance, therefore, the current macroeconomic conditions, outlook and \nuncertainties call for continuation of the policy repo rate of 5.5 per cent and wait for \nfurther transmission of the front-loaded rate cut to the credit markets and the broader \neconomy. Accordingly, the MPC unanimously voted to keep the repo rate unchanged. \nThe MPC further resolved to maintain a close vigil on the incoming data and the \nevolving domestic growth-inflation dynamics to chart out the appropriate monetary \npolicy path. Accordingly, all members decided to continue with the neutral stance. \nAssessment of Growth and Inflation \nGrowth \n7. \nDomestic growth is holding up and is broadly evolving along the lines of our \nassessment even though some high-frequency indicators showed mixed signals in \nMay-June. Rural consumption remains resilient1 while urban consumption revival, \nespecially discretionary spending, is tepid2. Fixed investment3 supported by buoyant \ngovernment capex continues to support economic activity. \n8. \n On the supply side, steady southwest monsoon4 is supporting kharif sowing,5 \nreplenishing reservoir levels6 and boosting agriculture activity. Moreover, services \nactivity remains steady, though some high-frequency indicators recorded a modest \nexpansion.7 Services PMI8 increased to an 11-month high of 60.5 in July 2025. \nConstruction activity continues to exhibit resilience.9 However, growth in the industrial \nsector remained subdued and uneven across segments, pulled down by electricity and \nmining.10 While the manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI)11 remained \nelevated in Q1, the Index of Industrial Production (IIP)12 showed moderation.  \n9. \nTurning to the growth outlook, the above normal southwest monsoon, lower \ninflation, rising capacity utilisation, and congenial financial conditions continue to \nsupport domestic economic activity. The supportive monetary, regulatory and fiscal \n                                                          \n1 Tractor sales and retail two-wheeler sales posted a growth of 9.2 per cent and 4.9 per cent, respectively, during Q1 of 2025-26.  \n2 As per the NielsenIQ\u2019s Retail Audit Service, FMCG sales volume grew by 6.0 per cent during Q1:2025-26, with rural and urban \nareas recording a growth of 8.4 per cent and 4.3 per cent, respectively. Retail sales of passenger vehicles grew by 3.0 per cent \nduring Q1 and domestic air passenger traffic expanded by 5.3 per cent during this period. \n3 Central government capital expenditure grew at a strong 52.0 per cent (y-o-y) during Q1:2025-26. Index of Industrial Production \nof capital goods expanded by 10.0 per cent and import of capital goods increased by 12.6 per cent in Q1:2025-26. \n4 As of August 4, 2025, the cumulative south-west monsoon (SWM) rainfall is 4 per cent above the long period average (LPA).  \n5  The area sown under kharif crops as on August 1, 2025, is 5.1 per cent higher than the corresponding acreage of previous \nyear. \n6 As of July 31, 2025, reservoir levels were at 69 per cent of the full capacity, well above last year\u2019s level as well as decadal \naverage of 46 per cent. \n7 E-way bills increased strongly by 19.3 per cent in June 2025 and toll collections increased by 15.2 per cent in June-July 2025. \nGrowth of gross GST collections moderated to 6.9 per cent in June-July 2025 after a 16.4 per cent growth in May. Domestic air \ncargo posted a growth of 2.6 per cent in June 2025; port cargo witnessed a growth of 5.6 per cent in Q1:2025-26; sales of \ncommercial vehicle contracted by 0.6 per cent in Q1. \n8 PMI services climbed up to 60.4 in June 2025 and further to 60.5 in July, from 58.8 in May. \n9 Steel consumption grew by 7.9 per cent in Q1:2025-26 and cement production posted a growth of 8.4 per cent during this period.  \n10  Mining and electricity output contracted by 3.0 per cent and 1.9 per cent, respectively, during Q1:2025-26. \n11 Manufacturing PMI surged to a 16-month high of 59.1 in July 2025, signalling robust momentum in the manufacturing sector. \n12 Manufacturing IIP recorded a modest growth of 3.4 per cent during Q1:2025-26. \n \n3 \n \npolicies including robust government capital expenditure,13 should also boost demand. \nWith sustained growth in construction and trade segments, the services sector is \nexpected to remain buoyant in the coming months. Prospects of external demand, \nhowever, remain uncertain amidst ongoing tariff announcements and trade \nnegotiations. The headwinds emanating from prolonged geopolitical tensions, \npersisting global uncertainties, and volatility in global financial markets pose risks to \nthe growth outlook.   Taking all these factors into account, real GDP growth for 2025-\n26 is projected at 6.5 per cent, with Q1 at 6.5 per cent, Q2 at 6.7 per cent, Q3 at 6.6 \nper cent, and Q4 at 6.3 per cent. Real GDP growth for Q1:2026-27 is projected at 6.6 \nper cent. The risks are evenly balanced. \nInflation \n10. \nCPI headline inflation declined for the eighth consecutive month to a 77-month \nlow of 2.1 per cent in June.14 This was driven primarily by a sharp decline in food \ninflation, led by improved agricultural activity and various supply side measures. Food \ninflation recorded its first negative print since February 2019 at (-) 0.2 per cent in June. \nDouble-digit deflation in vegetables and pulses drove this contraction.15 High-\nfrequency price indicators signal a continuation of the lower price momentum in food \nprices to July as well. Fuel group inflation moderated over two successive months to \nrecord 2.6 per cent in June.16 Core inflation,17 which remained within a narrow range \nof 4.1-4.2 per cent during February-May, increased to 4.4 per cent in June, partly \ndriven by a continued increase in gold prices. \n11. \nThe inflation outlook for 2025-26 has become more benign than expected in \nJune. Large favourable base effects combined with steady progress of the southwest \nmonsoon, healthy kharif sowing, adequate reservoir levels and comfortable buffer \nstocks of foodgrains18 have contributed to this moderation. CPI inflation, however, is \nlikely to edge up above 4 per cent in Q4:2025-26 and beyond, as unfavourable base \neffects, and demand side factors from policy actions come into play. Barring any major \nnegative shock to input prices, core inflation is likely to remain moderately above 4 per \ncent during the year. Weather-related shocks pose risks to inflation outlook. \nConsidering all these factors, CPI inflation for 2025-26 is now projected at 3.1 per cent \nwith Q2 at 2.1 per cent; Q3 at 3.1 per cent; and Q4 at 4.4 per cent. CPI inflation for \nQ1:2026-27 is projected at 4.9 per cent. The risks are evenly balanced. \n \n \n                                                          \n13 As per the Union Budget 2025-26, the central government\u2019s effective capital expenditure (including grants-in-aid for creation of \ncapital assets) is budgeted to grow by 17.4 per cent. \n14 CPI headline inflation declined to 2.1 per cent in June 2025 (lowest since January 2019) from 3.2 per cent in April, witnessing \na cumulative fall of around 110 bps. The moderation was primarily driven by a further easing in vegetables, pulses, and cereals \nprices, which resulted in deflation in the CPI food group for the first time since February 2019, at (-)0.2 per cent in June. Fuel \ngroup inflation also moderated to 2.6 per cent in June from 2.9 per cent in April. Core inflation, however, edged up to 4.4 per cent \nin June 2025 after remaining broadly steady between 4.1 to 4.2 per cent during February to May. \n15 Vegetable prices declined by 19.0 per cent while pulses prices declined by 11.8 per cent in June 2025. \n16 Fuel group inflation also moderated to 2.6 per cent in June from 2.9 per cent in April. \n17 CPI headline excluding food and fuel. \n18 As on July 16, 2025, the stocks held by the Food Corporation of India for wheat stands at 1.3 times the buffer norms (stocks \nhighest in last 4 years) and for rice, at 3.9 times the buffer norms. \n \n \n4 \n \nExternal Sector \n12. \nIndia\u2019s current account deficit (CAD) moderated to 0.6 per cent of GDP in 2024-\n25 from 0.7 per cent of GDP in 2023-24 due to robust services exports and strong \nremittances receipts despite higher merchandise trade deficit. Merchandise trade \ndeficit further widened in Q1 of 2025-26. India\u2019s share in world services exports has \nrisen markedly from about 2 per cent in 2005 to 4.3 per cent in 2024, driven by strong \nsoftware and business services exports. Robust services exports19 coupled with \nstrong remittance receipts are expected to keep CAD within the sustainable level \nduring the current financial year. \n \n13. \nOn the external financing side, gross foreign direct investment (FDI) to India \nremained strong during April-May 2025-26. However, net FDI moderated during this \nperiod due to higher outward FDI.20 Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows to EMEs \nhave remained strong in May and June 2025.21 However, net FPI to India recorded \noutflows of US$ 0.8 billion in 2025-26 so far (April-July 31) due to outflows in the debt \nsegment.22 External commercial borrowings, on the other hand, witnessed higher net \ninflows compared to last year. Inflows under non-resident deposits too remained \npositive, albeit witnessing some moderation.23 As on August 1, 2025, India\u2019s foreign \nexchange reserves stood at US$ 688.9 billion, sufficient to cover more than 11 months \nof merchandise imports.24 Overall, India\u2019s external sector remains resilient.25 We \nremain confident of meeting our external financing requirements comfortably. \nLiquidity and Financial Market Conditions \n14. \nSystem liquidity, as measured by the net position under the Liquidity \nAdjustment Facility (LAF), has been in surplus, on an average of \u20b93.0 lakh crore per \nday since the last MPC, as compared to an average daily surplus of \u20b91.6 lakh crore \nduring the previous two months.26 Going ahead, as the CRR cut announced in the last \npolicy comes into effect in a staggered manner beginning September, it would further \nsupport liquidity conditions.  \n                                                          \n19 As per provisional figures, India\u2019s services exports grew by 10.1 per cent during April-June 2025-26, while services imports \nincreased by 1.5 per cent during the same period. Net services exports grew by 20.7 per cent during the same period. \n20  Gross foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows grew by 5 per cent to US$ 15.9 billion in April-May 2025-26 from US$ 15.2 billion \nduring the same period a year ago. Net FDI inflows contracted by 2.2 per cent to US$ 3.9 billion in April-May 2025-26 from US$ \n4.0 billion a year ago. \n21 Net portfolio inflows into EMEs during June 2025 stood at US$ 42.8 billion as compared with US$ 16.8 billion in May 2025 \n(Source: Institute of International Finance).  \n22 During April-July 2025, there were net inflows of US$ 2.6 billion in equity segment whereas debt segment witnessed a net \noutflow of US$ 3.5 billion. \n23 Net inflows under external commercial borrowings to India increased to US$ 3.5 billion during April-June 2025-26 as compared \nwith US$ 1.6 billion a year ago. Non-resident deposits recorded a net inflow of US$ 1.9 billion in April-May 2025-26, lower than \nUS$ 2.8 billion in the same period last year. \n24 Based on actual merchandise imports (on a BoP basis) during the four quarters period (Q1:2024-25 to Q4:2024-25) and around \n94 per cent of total external debt as on end-March 2025. \n25 India\u2019s CAD/GDP ratio moderated to 0.6 per cent in 2024-25 from 0.7 per cent during 2023-24. India\u2019s external debt to GDP \nratio increased to 19.1 per cent at end-March 2025 from 18.5 per cent at end-March 2024. The net International Investment \nposition to GDP ratio improved to (-) 8.7 per cent from (-) 10.1 per cent during the same period. \n26 The average daily net absorption under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) during April and May stood at \u20b91.5 lakh crore and \n\u20b91.8 lakh crore, respectively. The average daily net absorption under the LAF further increased to \u20b92.82 lakh crore in June 2025 \nand \u20b93.12 lakh crore in July 2025. The daily average absorption under the SDF increased to \u20b92.17 lakh crore during June-July \nfrom \u20b92.06 lakh crore during April-May 2025. \n \n5 \n \n15. \nThe comfortable liquidity in the banking system has reinforced transmission of \nthe policy repo rate cuts to the money27, bond28 and credit markets during the current \neasing cycle. In the credit market, the weighted average lending rate (WALR) of \nscheduled commercial banks declined by 71 basis points for fresh rupee loans (of \nwhich 55 bps is due to interest rate reduction) and 39 basis points for outstanding \nrupee loans from February 2025 to June 2025. On the deposit side, the weighted \naverage domestic term deposit rate (WADTDR) on fresh deposits moderated by 87 \nbps during the same period. Moreover, the transmission to lending rates has been \nbroad based across sectors.   \n16. \nGoing ahead, the Reserve Bank will continue to be nimble and flexible in its \nliquidity management. We will endeavour to maintain sufficient liquidity in the banking \nsystem so that the productive requirements of the economy are met and transmission \nto money markets and credit markets remains smooth. \n17. \nAn internal Working Group has reviewed the Reserve Bank\u2019s extant Liquidity \nManagement Framework (LMF), operative since February 2020. The Group has \nsubmitted its report and the same will be placed on the RBI website shortly for public \nconsultation. The weighted average call rate (WACR) is found to be highly correlated \nwith other overnight money market rates (TREPS and Market Repo) in the \ncollateralised segments. Further, WACR is also found to be effective in transmitting \nsignals to other money market instruments across maturities. Therefore, the Group \nhas recommended continuation of overnight WACR as the operating target of \nmonetary policy. The Group has, inter alia, also recommended to continue with the \nvariable rate auction mechanism for repo and reverse repo operations of various \ntenors with the objective of maintaining the operating target rate at the policy rate.  \nFinancial Stability \n18. \nThe system-level financial parameters related to capital adequacy, liquidity, \nasset quality and profitability of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) continue to \nremain healthy.29 Credit Deposit Ratio (CD ratio) for the banking system at the end of \nJune 2025 was 78.9 per cent, broadly similar to that an year ago. Similarly, the system-\nlevel parameters of NBFCs too are sound, with adequate capital position and improved \nGNPA ratios.30  \n                                                          \n27 In response to the cumulative policy repo rate cut of 100 basis points (bps) in the current easing cycle (up to August 4), the \nWACR moderated by 108 bps. Since the February policy, 3-month T-bill rate declined by 110 bps, 3-month CP issued by NBFCs \nby 161 bps and 3-month CD rate by 170 bps. \n28 The 5-year and 10-year G-sec yield (6.79 GS benchmark) declined by 63 bps and 28 bps, respectively since the February \npolicy. Over the same period, 5-year AAA corporate bond yields declined by 56 basis points. During this period, the Indian bond \nmarket was one of the best performers globally. \n29 SCB Parameters: The outstanding credit and deposit on a y-o-y basis increased by 9.9 per cent and 10.5 per cent, respectively, \nbetween June-24 and June-25. The system-level Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of 17.44 per cent in June 2025 \nwas well above the regulatory minimum level. Ratio of non-performing loans improved further (GNPA ratio at 2.24 per cent in \nJune 2025 vis-\u00e0-vis 2.67 per cent in June 2024, NNPA Ratio at 0.53 per cent in June 2025 vis-\u00e0-vis 0.60 per cent in June 2024). \nLiquidity buffers were robust, with an LCR of 132.80 per cent as of end June 2025. The annualised return on assets (RoA) and \nreturn on equity (RoE) stood at 1.34 per cent and 12.70 per cent, respectively, in June 2025. Net Interest Margin was 3.24 per \ncent for June 2025 (3.54 per cent in June 2024). \n30 NBFC Parameters: Total CRAR of NBFCs was 25.78 per cent and Tier I CRAR was 23.83 per cent in June 2025, well above \nthe minimum regulatory requirements. GNPA ratio has improved from 2.47 per cent in June 2024 to 2.21 per cent in June 2025, \nwhile NNPA ratio also improved from 1.08 per cent in June 2024 to 0.95 per cent in June 2025. RoA for the sector decreased \nslightly from 3.23 per cent in June 2024 to 3.11 per cent in June 2025. NIM has slightly decreased from 4.82% in June 2024 to \n4.40% in June 2025.  \n \n \n6 \n \n19. \nBank credit grew at 12.1 per cent during 2024-25. While it is slower than the \ngrowth rate of 16.3 per cent in 2023-24, it is higher than the average growth rate of \n10.3 per cent recorded in the ten-year period preceding 2024-25. Moreover, while the \nflow of non-food bank credit during the financial year 2024-25 reduced by about \u20b93.4 \nlakh crore from \u20b921.4 lakh crore to almost \u20b918 lakh crore, the flow from non-bank \nsources more than made up for this decrease.31 Thus, even though growth rate of \nbank credit slowed last year, the overall flow of financial resources to the commercial \nsector increased from \u20b933.9 lakh crore in 2023-24 to \u20b934.8 lakh crore in 2024-25. This \ntrend continues during the current financial year as well.32 As transmission to money \nmarkets has been faster, large corporates increasingly relied on market-based \ninstruments such as commercial paper and corporate bonds to source funds, reducing \ntheir reliance on bank credit.33 Also, as the profitability of large corporates has \nincreased, their internal resources have become an important source for business \nexpansion.  \nAdditional Measures \n20. \nBefore I conclude, let me underline that for us at RBI, the interest and welfare \nof the citizens of India is foremost. It is the people of India, including those at the \nbottom of the pyramid, who are our raison detre, or the reason of our being. In this \nregard, I have three consumer-centric announcements to make. \n21. \nOne, as Jan-dhan Scheme completes 10 years, a large number of accounts \nhave fallen due for re-KYC. The banks are organising camps at Panchayat level from           \n1st July to 30th September, in an endeavour to provide services at customer doorsteps. \nApart from opening new bank accounts and re-KYC, the camps will focus on micro \ninsurance and pension schemes for financial inclusion and customer grievance \nredress. \n22. \nTwo, we will be standardising the procedure for settlement of claims in respect \nof bank accounts, and articles kept in safe custody or safe deposit lockers of deceased \nbank customers. This is expected to make settlement more convenient and simpler. \n23. \nThree, we are expanding the functionality in RBI Retail-Direct platform to enable \nretail investors to invest in treasury bills through systematic investment plans. \nConcluding Remarks \n24. \nI now make my concluding remarks. Despite a challenging external \nenvironment, the Indian economy is navigating a steady growth path with price \nstability. Monetary policy has appropriately used the policy space created by the \nbenign inflation outlook to support growth without compromising on the primary \nobjective of price stability. Transmission of our recent policy actions to the broader \neconomy is underway.  \n25. \nAs the Indian economy strives to attain its rightful place in the global economy, \nstronger policy frameworks across domains, and not just limited to monetary policy, \n                                                          \n31 The total flow of resources from non-banks (including domestic and foreign sources) increased by \u20b94.3 lakh crore from \u20b912.5 \nlakh crore in 2023-24 to \u20b916.8 lakh crore in 2024-25. \n32 Bank Credit recorded a growth (y-o-y) of 9.8 per cent as on July 11, 2025 as compared to 14.0 per cent a year ago. Despite \nthe slowdown in bank credit, the total flow of financial resources remained at almost similar levels during April-July 2025-26 as \ncompared with the corresponding period of last year. \n33 CP issuances by non-financial entities increased to 0.78 lakh crore in FY:2025-26 (up to June) compared to 0.30 lakh crore a \nyear ago. Corporate bonds issued by non-financial entities increased to 0.95 lakh crore in FY:2025-26 (up to June) compared to \n0.09 lakh crore a year ago. \n \n7 \n \nwill be pivotal in its journey. We, on our part, will continue to be agile and proactive in \nproviding a facilitative monetary policy based on incoming data and the evolution of \nthe growth-inflation dynamics. As always, we will have a clear, consistent and credible \ncommunication backed by actions necessary for the task at hand.  \nThank you. Namaskar and Jai Hind. \n \n \n                                                                                                  (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/842                                              Chief General Manager \n \n",

    "file_extracted_text": " \n \n \n1 \n \n \nAugust 06, 2025 \n \nMonetary Policy Statement, 2025-26 \nResolution of the Monetary Policy Committee  \nAugust 4 to 6, 2025 \n \nMonetary Policy Decisions \n \n     The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held its 56th meeting from August 4 to 6, \n2025 under the chairmanship of Shri Sanjay Malhotra, Governor, Reserve Bank of \nIndia. The MPC members Dr. Nagesh Kumar, Shri Saugata Bhattacharya, Prof. Ram \nSingh, Dr. Poonam Gupta and Dr. Rajiv Ranjan attended the meeting. \n \n2. \n After assessing the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the MPC \nvoted to maintain the policy repo rate at 5.50 per cent. Consequently, the standing \ndeposit facility (SDF) rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) remains \nunchanged at 5.25 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank \nRate at 5.75 per cent. This decision is in consonance with the objective of achieving \nthe medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a \nband of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. \n \nGrowth and Inflation Outlook \n \n3. \nThe global environment continues to be challenging. Although financial market \nvolatility and geopolitical uncertainties have abated somewhat from their peaks in \nrecent months, trade negotiation challenges continue to linger. Global growth, though \nrevised upwards by the IMF, remains muted. The pace of disinflation is slowing down, \nwith some advanced economies even witnessing an uptick in inflation. \n \n4. \nDomestic growth remains resilient and is broadly evolving along the lines of our \nassessment. Private consumption, aided by rural demand, and fixed investment, \nsupported by buoyant government capex, continue to boost economic activity. On the \nsupply side, a steady south-west monsoon is supporting kharif sowing, replenishing \nreservoir levels and boosting agriculture activity. Moreover, services sector and \nconstruction activity remain robust. However, growth in industrial sector remained \nsubdued and uneven across segments, pulled down by electricity and mining. \n \n5. \nAs for the growth outlook, the above normal southwest monsoon, lower \ninflation, rising capacity utilization and congenial financial conditions continue to \nsupport domestic economic activity. The supportive monetary, regulatory and fiscal \npolicies including robust government capital expenditure should also boost demand. \n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u036a\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0223\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0223\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u0367\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n \n \n \n2 \n \nThe services sector is expected to remain buoyant, with sustained growth in \nconstruction and trade in the coming months. Prospects of external demand, however, \nremain uncertain amidst ongoing tariff announcements and trade negotiations. The \nheadwinds emanating from prolonged geopolitical tensions, persisting global \nuncertainties, and volatility in global financial markets pose risks to the growth outlook. \nTaking all these factors into account, projection for real GDP growth for 2025-26 has \nbeen retained at 6.5 per cent, with Q1 at 6.5 per cent, Q2 at 6.7 per cent, Q3 at 6.6 \nper cent, and Q4 at 6.3 per cent. Real GDP growth for Q1:2026-27 is projected at 6.6 \nper cent (Chart 1). The risks are evenly balanced. \n \n \n6. \nCPI headline inflation declined for the eighth consecutive month to a 77-month \nlow of 2.1 per cent (y-o-y) in June 2025. This was driven primarily by a sharp decline \nin food inflation led by improved agricultural activity and various supply side measures. \nFood inflation recorded its first negative print since February 2019 at (-) 0.2 per cent \nin June. High-frequency price indicators signal a continuation of the lower price \nmomentum in food prices this year to July as well. Core inflation, which remained \nwithin a narrow range of 4.1-4.2 per cent during February-May, increased to 4.4 per \ncent in June, driven partly by a continued increase in gold prices. \n \n7. \nThe inflation outlook for 2025-26 has become more benign than expected in \nJune. Large favourable base effects combined with steady progress of the southwest \nmonsoon, healthy kharif sowing, adequate reservoir levels and comfortable buffer \nstocks of foodgrains have contributed to this moderation. CPI inflation, however, is \nlikely to edge up above 4 per cent by Q4:2025-26 and beyond, as unfavourable base \neffects, and demand side factors from policy actions come into play. Barring any major \nnegative shock to input prices, core inflation is likely to remain moderately above 4 per \ncent during the year. Weather-related shocks pose risks to inflation outlook. \nConsidering all these factors, CPI inflation for 2025-26 is now projected at 3.1 per cent \nwith Q2 at 2.1 per cent; Q3 at 3.1 per cent; and Q4 at 4.4 per cent. CPI inflation for \nQ1:2026-27 is projected at 4.9 per cent (Chart 2). The risks are evenly balanced. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nRationale for Monetary Policy Decisions \n \n8. \nThe MPC noted that the inflation outlook in the near term has become more \nbenign than anticipated earlier, and the average CPI inflation this year is expected to \nremain significantly below the target. This is driven mainly by lower food inflation that \nentered deflationary territory in June. However, CPI inflation is likely to edge up above \nthe 4 per cent target from Q4:2025-26 onwards. Moreover, core inflation has been \nrising steadily from the recent low of 3.6 per cent recorded during December-January \n2024-25 and averaged 4.3 per cent in Q1 this year. Core excluding precious metals \nhas witnessed an uptick and averaged 3.4 per cent in Q1. \n \n9. \nGrowth has held up well with some pick-up expected in the coming festive \nseason and is evolving in line with our assessment of 6.5 per cent for 2025-26. \n  \n10. \nThus, while headline inflation is much lower than projected earlier, it is mainly \ndue to volatile food prices, especially of vegetables. Core inflation, on the other hand, \nhas remained steady around the 4 per cent mark, as anticipated. Inflation is projected \nto go up from the last quarter of this financial year. Growth is robust and as per earlier \nprojections though below our aspirations. The uncertainties of tariffs are still evolving. \nMonetary policy transmission is continuing. The impact of the 100 bps rate cuts since \nFebruary 2025 on the economy is still unfolding. \n \n11. \nOn balance, therefore, the current macroeconomic conditions, outlook and \nuncertainties call for continuation of the policy repo rate of 5.5 per cent and wait for \nfurther transmission of the front-loaded rate cuts to the credit markets and the broader \neconomy. Accordingly, the MPC unanimously voted to keep the repo rate unchanged. \nThe MPC further resolved to maintain a close vigil on the incoming data and the \nevolving domestic growth-inflation dynamics to chart out the appropriate monetary \npolicy path. Accordingly, all members decided to continue with the neutral stance. \n \n12. \nThe minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on August 20, 2025. \n \n13. \nThe next meeting of the MPC is scheduled from September 29 to October 1, \n2025. \n \n \n \n               (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/841                                               Chief General Manager \n \n",

Under this arrangement, AD banks are permitted to open Special \nRupee Vostro Accounts (SRVAs) of correspondent banks, with the prior approval of the \nReserve Bank for settling cross-border trade transactions.   \n \n     Based on a review of the procedure involved in opening of the SRVA, it has been \ndecided to do away with the need for seeking RBI approval for opening of SRVA.
