This Report presents the performance of the banking sector, \nincluding commercial banks, co-operative banks and non-banking financial \ninstitutions, during 2024-25 and 2025-26 so far. \n \nHighlights \n \n\u2022 \nThe Indian commercial banking sector remained resilient during 2024-25, \nsupported by double-digit balance sheet expansion. Deposits and credit of \nscheduled commercial banks (SCBs) grew in double digits, albeit with a \nmoderation from the previous year. \n \n\u2022 \nThe capital to risk weighted assets ratio of SCBs was 17.4 per cent at end-\nMarch 2025 and 17.2 per cent at end-September 2025. \n \n\u2022 \nAsset quality strengthened further, with the gross non-performing assets \n(GNPA) ratio declining to a multi-decadal low of 2.2 per cent at end-March \n2025 and 2.1 per cent at end-September 2025. \n \n\u2022 \nProfitability of the SCBs remained robust with the return on assets (RoA) at \n1.4 per cent and return on equity (RoE) at 13.5 per cent in 2024-25. During \nH1: 2025-26, RoA and RoE of the SCBs stood at 1.3 per cent and 12.5 per \ncent, respectively. \n \n\u2022 \n The consolidated balance sheet of urban co-operative banks recorded higher \ngrowth in 2024-25 than that in the previous year. Their asset quality improved \nfor the fourth consecutive year, alongside strengthening of their capital buffers \nand profitability.   \n \n\u2022 \n The non-banking financial companies continued to record double digit credit \ngrowth along with robust capital buffers. Their asset quality also improved \nduring the year.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                   (Brij Raj)  \n \n      Press Release: 2025-2026/1786                                     Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
