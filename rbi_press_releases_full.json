No. \nNGP.DOS.SSM 2.No.S580/15-03-614/2025-2026 dated October 06, 2025, has issued \ncertain Directions to Samarth Sahakari Bank Ltd., Solapur (\u201cthe bank\u201d), whereby, as \nfrom the close of business on October 07, 2025, the bank shall not, without prior \napproval of RBI in writing, grant or renew any loans and advances, make any \ninvestment, incur any liability including borrowal of funds and acceptance of fresh \ndeposits, disburse or agree to disburse any payment whether in discharge of its \nliabilities and obligations or otherwise, enter into any compromise or arrangement and \nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets except as notified \nin the RBI Direction dated October 06, 2025, a copy of which has been directed to be \ndisplayed on the bank's website / premises for perusal by interested members of the \npublic. Considering the bank's current liquidity position, the bank has been directed \nnot to allow withdrawal of any amount from savings bank or current accounts or any \nother account of a depositor but is allowed to set off loans against deposits subject to \nthe conditions stated in the above RBI Directions. The bank may incur expenditure in \nrespect of certain essential items such as salaries of employees, rent, electricity bills, \netc., as specified in the said Directions. \n \n2. RBI has in the recent past engaged with the Board and Senior Management of the \nbank for improvement in its functioning. However, lack of concrete efforts taken by the \nbank to address the supervisory concerns and to protect the interest of depositors of \nthe bank, necessitated issuance of these Directions.  \n \n3. The eligible depositors would be entitled to receive deposit insurance claim amount \nof their deposits up to a monetary ceiling of \u20b95,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakh only) in \nthe same capacity and in the same right, from the Deposit Insurance and Credit \nGuarantee Corporation (DICGC), as applicable under the provisions of the DICGC \nAct, 1961, based on submission of willingness by the depositors concerned and after \ndue verification. The depositors may contact the bank officials for further information. \nDetails may also be accessed on the DICGC website: www.dicgc.org.in. \n \n4. The issue of the above Directions by the RBI should not per se be construed as \ncancellation of the banking license by RBI. The bank will continue to undertake \nbanking business subject to restrictions specified in the said Directions till its financial \nposition improves. The RBI continues to monitor the position of the bank and will take \nnecessary actions including modifications of these Directions, as warranted, \ndepending upon circumstances and in the interest of the depositors. \n \n \n \n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u093f\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central O\ufb03ce, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n5.

The \nAppellate Authority, which allowed the appeal, directed that a forensic audit of the \nbank be conducted for the FY 2013-14 to assess the financial position. RBI appointed \na forensic auditor, but the audit could not be completed due to the non-cooperation of \nthe bank. Meanwhile, the financial position of the bank continued to deteriorate as \nassessed by RBI.  \nThe Reserve Bank has therefore cancelled the licence of the bank as: \ni) The bank does not have adequate capital and earning prospects. As such, it \ndoes not comply with the provisions of Section 11(1) and Section 22 (3)(d) read \nwith Section 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. \nii) The bank has failed to comply with the requirements of Sections 22(3)(a), \n22(3)(b), 22(3)(c), 22(3)(d) and 22(3)(e) read with Section 56 of the Banking \nRegulation Act, 1949; \niii) The continuance of the bank is prejudicial to the interests of its depositors; \niv) The bank with its present financial position would be unable to pay its present \ndepositors in full; and \nv) Public interest would be adversely affected if the bank is allowed to carry on its  \nbanking business any further. \n2. Consequently, the bank ceases to carry on banking business with effect from the \nclose of business on October 07, 2025. The Registrar of Cooperative Societies, \nMaharashtra has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and \nappoint a liquidator for the bank.  \n3.

    "file_extracted_text": " \n October 07, 2025 \n \nRBI issues Draft Directions pursuant to Policy Announcement \n \n     In pursuance of the announcement made in the Statement on Developmental and \nRegulatory Policies dated October 01, 2025, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has \ntoday issued the following draft Directions: \n \nA. Draft Reserve Bank of India (Scheduled Commercial Banks - Capital \nCharge for Credit Risk \u2013 Standardised Approach) Directions, 2025 \n \n     The proposed Directions seek to implement one of the key elements of the global \nreforms implemented by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), \nsuitably tailored to the Indian context. The Directions amend the existing \nstandardised approach framework for calculating the capital charge for credit risk with \nthe objective of enhancing its robustness, granularity, and risk sensitivity.  \nThe major revisions include:  \n \ni) nuanced and granular risk weight treatment for exposures to corporates, \nMSMEs and real estate; \n \nii) inclusion of \u2018transactors\u2019 under regulatory retail category, where transactors \nare credit cards with timely repayments during the previous 12 months; \n \niii) revision in the credit conversion factors for reckoning the exposure for off-\nbalance sheet exposures; \n \niv) suitable adjustments to the risk weights applied to loans rated by credit rating \nagencies, depending on the default history of such loans for each rating \nagency, and due diligence by banks.  \n \n     Overall, the proposed changes are estimated to have a positive impact on the \nminimum regulatory capital requirements of banks, with certain segments such as \nMSMEs, real estate and credit cards exposures being particularly benefited.  \n \nB. Draft Reserve Bank of India (Scheduled Commercial Banks & All India \nFinancial Institutions - Asset Classification, Provisioning and Income \nRecognition) Directions, 2025  \n     The proposed Directions seek to replace the incurred-loss-based provisioning \nframework with an ECL based provisioning, subject to prudential floors. These are  \nexpected to further strengthen credit risk management practices, promote greater \ncomparability across financial institutions, and align regulatory norms with \ninternationally accepted regulatory and accounting standards.  \n \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \nThe key elements of the proposed framework include: \n(i) introduction of staging criteria for asset classification under Expected Credit \nLoss (ECL) approach, while retaining the extant norms for Non-performing \nAsset (NPA) classification;  \n(ii) specification of suitably calibrated prudential floors for broad exposure \nclasses, separately under Stage-1, Stage-2 and Stage-3;  \n(iii) alignment of the income recognition norms based on Effective Interest Rate \n(EIR) method; \n(iv) broad principles on model risk management for implementing ECL models. \n     While the above Directions are estimated to result in an additional one-time \nprovisioning, the overall impact on the minimum regulatory capital requirements of \nbanks is expected to be minimal, with all banks continuing to meet the requirements \ncomfortably.  The proposed 5-year glide-path will further facilitate the transition in a \nnon-disruptive manner.  \n \n     The comments on the draft guidelines are invited from public/stakeholders by \nNovember 30, 2025.

The survey is for the reference \nperiod July \u2013 September 2025 (Q2:2025-26).  \n \n     The Reserve Bank has been conducting the Order Books, Inventories and Capacity \nUtilisation Survey (OBICUS) of the manufacturing sector on a quarterly basis since \n2008. The information collected in the survey includes quantitative data on new orders \nreceived during the reference quarter, backlog of orders at the beginning of the quarter, \npending orders at the end of the quarter, total inventories with a breakup between \n\ufb01nished goods (FG), work-in-progress (WiP) and raw material (RM) inventories at the \nend of the quarter, item-wise production in terms of quantity and value during the \nquarter vis-\u00e0-vis the installed capacity from the targeted group and the reasons for \nchanges in production / installed capacity during the quarter. The level of capacity \nutilisation (CU) is estimated from these responses. The survey provides valuable input \nfor monetary policy formulation. The survey findings are released on the website of the \nBank regularly. \n \n     During this quarter, selected manufacturing companies will be approached by the \nBank.

This penalty has been imposed in exercise of \npowers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read with Sections \n46(4)(i) and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.  \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by the RBI with reference to \nits financial position as on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice \nwas issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be \nimposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the \nbank's reply to the notice, oral submissions made during the personal hearing and \nadditional submissions made by it, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charges \nagainst the bank were sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty:  \n \nThe bank had failed to:  \n \ni) \nensure end-use of funds with respect to certain loan sanctioned by it; and \nii) \nenable its customers to instantly respond by \"Reply\" to the SMS alerts to \nnotify the objection towards unauthorised electronic banking transactions, \nif any. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers.

The draft directions inter alia, propose to replace the extant framework \nbased on incurred loss with an Expected Credit Loss (ECL) approach, subject to a \nprudential floor, while retaining the existing asset classification norms. The guidelines \nare expected to enhance credit risk management practices, promote better \ncomparability of reported financials across institutions. The framework is designed to \nbe implemented in a non-disruptive manner with a suitable glide-path.  \n \n2. \nBasel III Guidelines on Capital Charge for Credit Risk \u2013 Standardised \nApproach \n \n     As a part of the broader objective of improving the resilience of the banking sector \nand aligning the regulatory framework with the best international practices, it is \nproposed to issue the draft guidelines on implementation of the revised Basel \nframework on Standardised Approach for Credit Risk for Scheduled Commercial \nBanks (excluding Small Finance Banks, Payments Banks, and Regional Rural \nBanks).The revised framework aims to improve the robustness, granularity and risk \nsensitivity of the standardized approach for calculating the capital charge for credit \nrisk. The draft guidelines shall be issued shortly.   \n \n3. \nForms of Business and Prudential Regulation for Investments \n \n     The draft guidelines on forms of business and investment for banks which was \nissued in October 2024 has been finalised and shall be issued shortly. Based on \nfeedback and review, the proposed bar on overlap in the businesses undertaken by a \nbank and its group entity is being removed. The circular envisages to streamline the \nactivities being undertaken by banks and their group entities while providing more \n \n \n2 \n \noperational freedom to the banks and NOFHCs for equity investments and setting up \ngroup entities respectively. \n \n4. \nIntroduction of Risk Based Premium Framework for Deposit Insurance in \nIndia \n \n     Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), under the DICGC \nAct, 1961 has been operating the deposit insurance scheme since 1962 on a flat rate \npremium basis. At present, the banks are charged a premium of 12 paise per \u20b9100 of \nassessable deposits. While the existing system is simple to understand and \nadminister, it does not differentiate between banks based on their soundness. It is, \ntherefore, proposed to introduce a Risk Based Premium model which will help banks \nthat are more sound to save significantly on the premium paid. Detailed notification \nwill be issued shortly, which will be effective from the next financial year.  \n \n5. \nReview of Capital Market Exposures Guidelines for banks \n  \n     Capital market exposures (CME) of the regulated entities (REs) which include, inter \nalia, lending against securities to individuals and lending to capital market \nintermediaries, have been subject to prudential regulations relating to sectoral \nexposure limits, single borrower limits, margin requirements, etc. Further, bank finance \nfor acquisition of shares has been generally disallowed. \n  \n     There has been significant growth and development in the capital market structure, \nalong with strengthening of the banking system in recent years. With the objective of \nrationalising the extant guidelines and broadening the scope for capital market lending \nby banks and other regulated entities, it is proposed to inter alia: \n \n\u2022 provide an enabling framework for banks to finance acquisitions by Indian \ncorporates;  \n\u2022 enhance the limit for lending by banks against shares, units of REITs, units of \nInvITs while removing the regulatory ceiling altogether on lending against listed \ndebt securities; and \n\u2022 put in place a more principle-based framework for lending to capital market \nintermediaries.  \n \nThe draft guidelines shall be issued shortly. \n \n6. \nGuidelines on Enhancing Credit Supply for Large Borrowers through \nMarket Mechanism \u2013 Withdrawal \n \n     The Guidelines on Enhancing Credit Supply for Large Borrowers through Market \nMechanism were introduced in August 2016 with an objective to address the \nconcentration risk arising from the aggregate credit exposure of the banking system \nto a single large corporate and encourage such large corporates to diversify their \nsources of funding.  Upon review, considering, inter-alia, the changes evident in the \nprofile of bank funding to corporate sector since the introduction of the Guidelines, it \nis proposed to withdraw the guidelines. While the Large Exposures Framework since \nput in place for banks addresses concentration risk at an individual bank-level, \nconcentration risk at the banking system level, as and when considered as a risk, will \n \n \n3 \n \nbe managed through specific macroprudential tools. The draft circular to withdraw \nthese guidelines shall be issued shortly for public comments. \n  \n7. \nRisk Weights on infrastructure lending by NBFCs \n  \n     Infrastructure projects that have commenced operations typically exhibit lower risk \ncompared to those under construction. Recognizing this risk differential, the existing \ncapital adequacy norms permit NBFCs to assign a lower risk weight to operational \nprojects under Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). With a view to further rationalise \nthe risk weights for infrastructure lending by NBFCs in line with the nuanced risk-profile \nof operational projects, it has been decided to introduce a principle-based framework. \nThe framework aims to align risk weights with the actual risk characteristics of \noperational infrastructure projects, promoting better risk assessment and capital \nallocation. Draft regulations in this regard shall be issued shortly for public \nconsultation. \n \n8. \nDiscussion Paper on Licensing Framework for new Urban Co-operative \nBanks (UCBs) \n  \n     Since 2004, issuance of fresh license for UCBs had been paused following weak \nfinancial health of the UCB Sector. Considering that more than two decades have \npassed since then and the positive developments in the sector, a discussion paper on \nlicensing of new Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) will be issued shortly.   \n \n9. \nConsolidation of Regulatory Instructions \n \n     The evolution of regulatory framework administered by the Reserve Bank has \nresulted in proliferation of several circulars and directions.  In order to provide ease of \naccess and reduce the compliance cost faced by the regulated entities, the Reserve \nBank has undertaken an exercise of consolidating the regulatory instructions \nadministered by the Department of Regulation of the Reserve Bank into a set of Master \nDirections on an \u2018as is\u2019 basis The drafts of about 250 Master Directions consolidating \nextant instructions on up to 30 areas for 11 types of regulated entities shall be placed \non the website shortly for comments on their completeness and accuracy.  \n \n10. \nReview of Restrictions on Transaction Accounts \n  \n     With the objective of enforcing credit discipline among borrowers as well as to \nfacilitate better monitoring by lenders, certain restrictions were placed on the operation \nof Current Accounts (CA), Cash Credit Accounts (CC) and Overdraft Accounts (OD) \n(\u201cTransaction Accounts\u201d) offered by banks vide various circulars issued from time to \ntime. Based on the experience gained and feedback received, these instructions have \nbeen reviewed and it is proposed to ease some of the stipulations and provide greater \nflexibility to the banks in this regard, particularly in case of borrowers being entities \nregulated by a financial sector regulator. The draft guidelines shall be issued shortly.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nII. \nForeign Exchange Management \n \n11. \nForeign Currency accounts by Indian exporters- extension of time period \nfor repatriation from accounts held in IFSC in India \n  \n     In January 2025, RBI had permitted Indian exporters to open foreign currency \naccounts with a bank outside India for realisation of export proceeds. Funds in these \naccounts can be used for making import payment or have to be repatriated by the end \nof next month from the date of receipt of the funds. It has now been decided to extend \nthe time period for repatriation, from one month to three months, in case of such \nforeign currency accounts maintained in IFSC in India. This will encourage Indian \nexporters to open accounts with IFSC Banking Units and also increase forex liquidity \nin IFSC.  The amendments to regulations will be notified shortly. \n \n12. \nMerchanting Trade Transactions (MTT) \n \n     Global uncertainties in trade are resulting in supply chain disruptions, making it \nchallenging for Indian merchants to meet their contractual obligations in time. In terms \nof extant guidelines on MTT, outlay of foreign exchange is allowed upto four months. \nIt has now been decided to increase the period for the forex outlay from four months \nto six months, in case of MTT. This relaxation is expected to help Indian merchants \novercome the challenges they face in completing their business transactions efficiently \nwhile maintaining profitability. The amendments to regulations will be notified shortly. \n \n13. \nRelaxation \nin \ncompliance \nrequirements \nfor \nSmall \nValue \nExporters/Importers \n \n     With a view to ease compliance for exporters/importers, especially of small value \ngoods and services, it has been decided to simplify the process of reconciliation in \nExport Data Processing and Monitoring System (EDPMS) and Import Data Processing \nand Monitoring System (IDPMS). \n \n     As per the revised guidelines, bills can be reconciled and closed by an AD bank in \nEDPMS or IDPMS, based on a declaration by the concerned exporter or importer, as \nthe case may be, that the amount has been realised, for a shipping bill, or paid against \na Bill of Entry, for entries (including outstanding entries) in EDPMS/IDPMS of value \nequivalent to INR 10 lakh per bill, or less.  \n  \n     The revised procedure will also enable reduction in the realisable value of bills by \nAD banks based on such declaration.  This measure is expected to reduce compliance \nburden on small value exporters and importers and enhance ease of doing business. \nThe directions will be issued shortly. \n \n14. \nReview of External Commercial Borrowing Framework  \n \n     With an objective to rationalise and simplify the regulations governing External \nCommercial Borrowings (ECB), the Reserve Bank of India has undertaken a review of \nthe existing provisions under the Foreign Exchange Management (Borrowing and \nLending) Regulations, 2018. \n  \n \n \n5 \n \n     Based on the review, a revised framework that provides for expansion of eligible \nborrower and recognized lender base, rationalization of borrowing limits, \nrationalization of restrictions on average maturity period, removal of restrictions on the \ncost of borrowing for ECBs, review of end-use restrictions and simplification of \nreporting requirements, is proposed to be introduced.  The draft Framework will be \nissued shortly. \n  \n15. \nRationalisation of regulations for Establishment in India of a Branch \nOffice or a Liaison Office or a Project Office or any other place of business \n \n     The extant regulations for \u201cEstablishment in India of a Branch Office or a Liaison \nOffice or a Project Office or any other place of business\u201d were issued by the Reserve \nBank in 2016. The regulations have been comprehensively reviewed. The revised \nregulations are principle driven and enable delegation of more powers to AD banks \nand reduction of compliance burden, thereby further enhancing the ease of doing \nbusiness in India. The draft regulations will be issued shortly.  \n \nIII. \nConsumer Protection \n \n16. \nReview of instructions on Basic Savings Bank Deposit (BSBD) Account \n \n     BSBD Account is a savings bank account which was introduced with the objective \nof promoting financial inclusion. The extant instructions on BSBD account require \nbanks to provide certain minimum facilities free of charge, without the requirement of \nminimum balance, to the holders of such accounts. The ongoing digitalization in the \nbanking sector necessitates a BSBD account that is in sync with the customer\u2019s \nchanging requirements. Therefore, it has been decided to review the extant \ninstructions on BSBD account to provide affordable banking facilities to the public and \ndrive enhanced usage of BSBD accounts to deepen financial inclusion. \n \n17. \nMeasures for strengthening the Internal Ombudsman mechanism in REs  \n \n     The Reserve Bank has institutionalized the Internal Ombudsman (IO) mechanism \nin select Regulated Entities (REs) which enables an independent apex level review of \ncomplaints that are being rejected by the RE. To further improve upon the efficacy of \nthis mechanism, it is proposed that the IOs be equipped with compensation powers \nand be allowed access to the complainant, aligning the role of IOs more closely with \nthat of the RBI Ombudsman. Additionally, a two-tiered structure may be introduced \nwithin REs for grievance redress prior to escalation to the IO. These measures aim to \nprovide meaningful and timely resolution of customer grievances within the REs, \nthereby improving service standards and consumer confidence. A draft of the Master \nDirection, outlining these revisions, is being released shortly for public feedback. \n \n18. \nReview of the Reserve Bank \u2013 Integrated Ombudsman Scheme, 2021 \n \n     The Reserve Bank \u2013 Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS) (the Scheme), \n2021 launched on November 12, 2021, provides customers of Regulated Entities \n(REs) a speedy, cost-effective and expeditious alternate grievance redress \nmechanism. The REs currently covered under the Scheme include Commercial \nBanks, Regional Rural Banks, Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks, Non-\n \n \n6 \n \nScheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks with deposits size of \u20b950 crore and \nabove, select Non-Banking Financial Companies and Credit Information Companies. \n  \n     To enable the customers of the rural co-operative banks to access the mechanism \nof RBI Ombudsman, it has been decided to bring State Co-operative Banks and \nDistrict Central Cooperative Banks, hitherto with NABARD, within the scope of the RBI \nOmbudsman Scheme. Notification will be issued shortly in this regard. \n \n     Moreover, based on the operational experience, stakeholder feedback, and global \nbest practices, the Reserve Bank has undertaken a comprehensive review of the \nScheme. The review seeks to enhance clarity, simplify procedures and reduce \ntimelines to further improve timely, fair, and effective redress. The draft Scheme shall \nbe placed on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website shortly for seeking feedback from \nstakeholders. \nIV. \nFinancial Markets \n \n19. \nLending in Indian Rupees (INR) by Authorised Dealer (AD) banks to \nPersons Resident Outside India  \n \n     In order to promote the settlement of cross border transactions in INR and local \ncurrencies, the Reserve Bank of India has been progressively liberalising regulations \nunder the Foreign Exchange Management Act. To take this initiative further, it is \nessential that INR liquidity is made available and accessible to residents of other \ncountries. As a calibrated step in this direction, it has been decided that AD banks in \nIndia and their overseas branches may be permitted to lend in INR to persons resident \nin Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, including a bank in these jurisdictions, to facilitate \ncross border trade transactions. The amendments to regulations will be notified \nshortly. \n  \n20. \nAdditional Reference Rates to be published by Financial Benchmarks \nIndia Limited \n \n     Over the years, the development of forex market has facilitated the growing \nintegration of the Indian economy with the rest of the world in terms of trade and capital \nflows. At present, Financial Benchmarks India Limited (FBIL) publishes reference rates \nfor USD, EUR, GBP and JPY against INR. These rates are widely used for settlement \nof forex transactions including derivatives. It is now proposed to include select \ncurrencies of India\u2019s major trading partners in the list of reference rates published by \nFBIL. This is expected to further deepen the onshore forex market and encourage \nbanks to quote directly in a larger set of currency pairs, thus eliminating the need for \nmultiple currency conversions and making trade more efficient. FBIL has been advised \nto publish the new reference rates in consultation with the market. \n \n21. \nExpanding the bouquet of investments for Special Rupee Vostro \nAccounts (SRVA) holders \n \n     To promote exports from India and to support increasing interest of global trading \ncommunity in INR, RBI had permitted Special Rupee Vostro Accounts (SRVA) in July \n2022 to facilitate invoicing, payment, and settlement of exports / imports in INR. The \narrangement permitted, inter alia, Rupee surplus balances in SRVA to be invested in \n \n \n7 \n \ngovernment securities including treasury bills. To expand investment opportunities in \nIndia for SRVA holders, it has now been decided to permit balances of these accounts \nto be invested in corporate bonds and commercial papers. The revised regulations will \nbe notified shortly.  \n \n                                                                                                   (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1218                                            Chief General Manager \n",

    "file_extracted_text": " \nOctober 01, 2025 \n \nGovernor\u2019s Statement: October 1, 2025 \n \n     Namaskar. Greetings on the last day of Navaratri, and my best wishes for a \nHappy Dussehra and Gandhi Jayanti tomorrow. \n2. \nSince the August policy meeting, significant developments on the domestic \nfront amidst a fast-changing global economic landscape have altered the narrative on \ngrowth-inflation dynamics in India. Buoyed by a good monsoon, the Indian economy \ncontinues to exhibit strength by registering a higher growth in Q1:2025-26. At the \nsame time, there has been a considerable moderation in headline inflation. The \nrationalisation of the goods and services tax (GST) rates is likely to have a sobering \nimpact on inflation while stimulating consumption and growth. Tariffs on the other \nhand will moderate exports. \n3. \nAs for the global economy, it has been more resilient than anticipated, with \nrobust growth in the US and China. The outlook, however, remains clouded amidst \nelevated policy uncertainty. Inflation has remained above respective targets in some \nadvanced economies, posing fresh challenges for central banks as they navigate the \nshifting growth\u2013inflation dynamics. Financial markets have been volatile.  The US \ndollar strengthened after the upward revision of US growth numbers for the second \nquarter, and treasury yields hardened recently as expectations of rate cuts by the \nFederal Reserve ebbed. Equities have remained buoyant across several advanced \nand emerging economies.  \nDecisions of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) \n4. \nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 29th, 30th of September and \n1st October to deliberate and decide on the policy repo rate. After a detailed \nassessment of the evolving macroeconomic conditions and the outlook, the MPC \nvoted unanimously to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 5.50 per cent; \nconsequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains at 5.25 per cent while \nthe marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate remain at 5.75 per cent. \nThe MPC also decided to continue with the neutral stance. \n5. \nI shall now briefly set out the rationale for these decisions. The MPC observed \nthat the overall inflation outlook has turned even more benign in the last few months, \ndue to a sharp decline in food prices and the rationalisation of GST rates. The \naverage headline inflation for 2025-26 has been revised lower from 3.7 per cent \nprojected in June and 3.1 per cent in August, to 2.6 per cent. Headline inflation for \nQ4:2025-26 and Q1:2026-27 too have been revised downwards and are broadly \naligned with the target, despite unfavourable base effects. Core inflation for this year \nand Q1:2026-27 is also expected to remain contained. \n6. \nThe MPC also noted that growth outlook remains resilient supported by \ndomestic drivers, despite weak external demand. It is likely to get further support \nfrom a favourable monsoon, lower inflation, monetary easing and the salubrious \n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u0930\u0930\u091c\u093c\u0930\u094d\u0935 \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u0935\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u0938\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u093e, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u093e, \u092e \u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \nimpact of recent GST reforms. However, growth continues to be below our \naspirations. Even though the growth projection for the current financial year is being \nrevised upwards, the forward-looking projections for Q3 and beyond are expected to \nbe slightly lower than projected earlier, primarily due to trade related headwinds, \ndespite being partially offset by the impetus provided by the rationalisation of GST \nrates. \n7. \nSummarising, the MPC concluded that there has been a significant \nmoderation in inflation. Moreover, the prevailing global uncertainties and tariff related \ndevelopments are likely to decelerate growth in H2:2025-26 and beyond. The current \nmacroeconomic conditions and the outlook has opened up policy space for further \nsupporting growth. However, the MPC noted that the impact of the front-loaded \nmonetary policy actions and the recent fiscal measures is still playing out. The trade \nrelated uncertainties are also unfolding. The MPC, therefore, considered it prudent to \nwait for the impact of policy actions to play out and greater clarity to emerge before \ncharting the next course of action. Accordingly, the MPC unanimously voted to keep \nthe policy repo rate unchanged at 5.5 per cent and decided to retain the stance at \nneutral.  \nAssessment of Growth and Inflation  \nGrowth \n8. \nEconomic activity has remained resilient with growth of real gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) surprising on the upside at 7.8 per cent and gross value added (GVA) \nat 7.6 per cent for Q1: 2025-26.1 As suggested by high frequency indicators available \nso far, domestic economic activity continues to sustain momentum in Q2:2025-26.2  \n9. \nLooking ahead, an above normal monsoon, good progress of kharif sowing \nand adequate reservoir levels have further brightened prospects of agriculture and \nrural demand. Buoyancy in services sector coupled with steady employment \nconditions are supportive of demand, which is expected to get a further boost from \nthe rationalisation of GST. Rising capacity utilisation, conducive financial conditions, \nand improving domestic demand should continue to facilitate fixed investment. \nHowever, ongoing tariff and trade policy uncertainties will impact external demand. \nProlonged geopolitical tensions and volatility in international financial markets caused \nby risk-off sentiments of investors pose downside risks to the growth outlook. The \nimplementation of several growth-inducing structural reforms, including streamlining \nof GST are expected to offset some of the adverse effects of the external headwinds. \nTaking all these factors into account, real GDP growth for 2025-26 is now projected \nat 6.8 per cent, with Q2 at 7.0 per cent, Q3 at 6.4 per cent, and Q4 at 6.2 per cent. \nReal GDP growth for Q1:2026-27 is projected at 6.4 per cent. The risks are evenly \nbalanced. \n \n \n \n \n1 During Q1:2025-26, private final consumption, government consumption, and gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) grew by 7.0 \nper cent, 7.4 per cent, and 7.8 per cent, respectively. Real GVA of agriculture, manufacturing and services posted a growth of \n3.7 per cent, 7.7 per cent and 9.0 per cent, respectively, in Q1. \n2 Tractor and two-wheelers sales grew robustly by 17.3 per cent and 7.9 per cent, respectively, during July-August 2025. \nAccording to NielsenIQ, FMCG sales volume increased by 8.3 per cent and 4.1 per cent, respectively, in rural and urban areas \nduring July-August 2025. Domestic air passenger traffic contracted by 1.7 per cent during this period. Consumption of finished \nsteel and production of cement increased by 8.7 per cent and 8.8 per cent, respectively in July-August 2025. Domestic \nproduction of capital goods expanded at 5.6 per cent in July-August 2025 following a strong growth during Q1:2025-26 at 9.8 \nper cent, while imports of capital gods expanded by 5.4 per cent during July-August. Manufacturing PMI surged to a 17.5-year \nhigh of 59.3 in August, along with strong business optimism. Services PMI reached a 15-year high of 62.9 in August 2025, led \nby rising new orders. \n3 \nInflation \n10.\nInflation conditions remained benign during 2025-26 so far with actual\noutcomes turning out to be significantly lower than projections.3 Low inflation is\nprimarily attributed to a sharp fall in food inflation,4 aided by improved supply\nprospects and measures by the government to effectively manage the supply chain.5\nCore inflation6 remained largely contained with the August reading at 4.2 per cent,\ndespite continued price pressures on precious metals.7\n11.\nTurning to the inflation outlook, the progress of the southwest monsoon has\nbeen satisfactory. Healthy kharif sowing8, adequate reservoir levels9 and comfortable\nbuffer stocks of food-grains10 should keep food prices benign. The recently\nimplemented GST rate rationalisation would lead to a reduction in prices of several\nitems in the CPI basket. Overall, the inflation outcome is likely to be softer than what\nwas projected in August, primarily on account of the GST rate cuts and benign food\nprices. Considering all these factors, CPI inflation for 2025-26 is now projected at 2.6\nper cent with Q2 at 1.8 per cent; Q3 at 1.8 per cent; and Q4 at 4.0 per cent. CPI\ninflation for Q1:2026-27 is projected at 4.5 per cent The risks are evenly balanced.\nExternal Sector \n12.\nIndia\u2019s current account deficit moderated to US$ 2.4 billion (0.2 per cent of\nGDP) in Q1:2025-26 as compared with US$ 8.6 billion (0.9 per cent of GDP) in\nQ1:2024-25 due to increased net services surplus and strong remittance receipts\ndespite higher merchandise trade deficit.11 During July-August 2025, merchandise\ntrade deficit continued to remain elevated. Notwithstanding rising global trade\nuncertainties, India\u2019s services exports, driven by software and business services,\nwitnessed robust growth in July-August 2025.12 Furthermore, robust services exports\ncoupled with strong remittance receipts is expected to keep the current account\ndeficit (CAD) sustainable during 2025-26.\n13.\nOn the external financing side, net foreign direct investment reached a 38-\nmonth high in July 2025, driven by increased gross foreign direct investment and a\nmoderation in repatriation and outward foreign direct investment.13 However, net FPI\nrecorded outflows of US$ 3.9 billion in 2025-26 so far (April 01-September 29) due to\n3 The actual outcomes for Q1 and projection for Q2 of 2025-26 turned out to be lower by 90 bps and 210 bps, respectively, that \nwhat was set out in April policy, primarily on account of the faster than expected decline in food inflation. Core inflation largely \nevolved as projected.  \n4 Food group registered a deflation of -0.8 per cent in July (lowest since January 2019), before closing with zero inflation in \nAugust 2025.  \n5 Within food group, deflation was observed in prices of vegetables (-15.9 per cent), pulses (-14.5 per cent), and spices (-3.2 per \ncent) in August. Decline in inflation within cereals sub-group to 2.7 per cent in August 2025 as compared with 7.3 per cent a year \nago also contributed to the overall moderation in food inflation. \n6 CPI headline excluding food and fuel. \n7 Core excluding gold and silver recorded a y-o-y inflation on 3.0 per cent in August 2025.  \n8 As on September 19, 2025, the area sown under kharif crops stood at 11.2 crore hectares, 2.2 per cent over higher than the \nnormal sowing area for the season. \n9 As of September 25, 2025, reservoir levels stood at 90 per cent of total capacity, exceeding the levels recorded a year ago \nand the decadal average. \n10 As on September 16, 2025, the Food Corporation of India\u2019s wheat stocks were 1.2 times the buffer norms (highest in last 4 \nyears) while rice stocks were 3.5 times the buffer norms. \n11 In this context, it is pertinent to inform that we have reduced the time lag of releasing the quarterly balance of payments data \nand press release from 90 days to 60 days. \n12 As per provisional figures, India\u2019s services exports grew by 6.5 per cent during July-August 2025, while services imports \nincreased by 1.5 per cent during this period. Net services exports grew by 12.2 per cent during July-August 2025. \n13 Gross foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows grew by 33.2 per cent to US$ 37.7 billion in April-July 2025-26 from US$ 28.3 \nbillion during the same period a year ago. Net FDI inflows increased by more than 200 per cent to US$ 10.8 billion in April-July \n2025-26 from US$ 3.5 billion a year ago. \n4 \n \noutflows in both equity and debt segments.14 As on September 26, 2025, India\u2019s \nforeign exchange reserves stood at US$ 700.2 billion, sufficient to cover more than \n11 months of merchandise imports.15  Overall, India\u2019s external sector continues to be \nresilient, and we remain confident of meeting our external obligations comfortably.16 \n14. \nNotwithstanding the robust domestic macroeconomic fundamentals, the INR \nhas witnessed some depreciation accompanied by phases of volatility. RBI is keeping \na close watch on movements of the INR and will take appropriate steps, as \nwarranted. \nLiquidity and Financial Market Conditions \n15. \nSystem liquidity, as measured by the net position under the Liquidity \nAdjustment Facility (LAF), stood at an average daily surplus of \u20b92.1 lakh crore since \nthe last MPC meeting in August 2025.17 Going ahead, the drawdown of government \ncash balances and the remaining 75 basis points cut in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) \nduring October-November will aid banking system liquidity in the near-term. Through \nour two-way operations, we will actively manage liquidity to anchor short-term rates. \n16. \nMoney market rates have remained relatively stable amidst comfortable \nliquidity conditions.18 During February-August 2025, in response to the 100-basis \npoints (bps) cut in the policy repo rate, the weighted average lending rate (WALR) of \nScheduled Commercial Banks moderated by 58 bps for fresh rupee loans; 71 bps is \non account of interest rate effect. The moderation for outstanding rupee loans is to \nthe extent of 55 bps. On the deposit side, the weighted average domestic term \ndeposit rate (WADTDR) on fresh deposits declined by 106 bps, while that on \noutstanding deposits softened by 22 bps over the same period. Transmission has \nbeen broad-based across sectors. Going forward, adequate liquidity in the system \nand the remaining CRR cuts will further facilitate monetary transmission. \nFinancial Stability \n17. \nThe system-level financial parameters related to capital adequacy, liquidity, \nasset quality and profitability of the Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) continue to \nremain healthy.19 Similarly, the system-level parameters of NBFCs too are sound, \nwith adequate capital and improved GNPA ratios20. \n \n14 During April-September 2025 (till September 29), there were net outflows of US$ 3.3 billion and US$ 0.6 billion in equity and \ndebt segments, respectively.  \n15 Based on actual merchandise imports (on a BoP basis) during the four quarters period (Q2:2024-25 to Q1:2025-26), sufficient \nto cover around nine months of imports of goods and services combined and around 94 per cent of total external debt as on \nend-June 2025. \n16 India\u2019s CAD/GDP ratio moderated to 0.6 per cent in 2024-25 from 0.7 per cent during 2023-24. India\u2019s external debt to GDP \nratio moderated to 18.9 per cent at end-June 2025 from 19.1 per cent at end-March 2025. The net International Investment \nposition to GDP ratio improved to (-) 8.0 per cent from (-) 8.6 per cent during the same period. \n17 The average daily net absorption under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) during June and July stood at \u20b92.8 lakh crore \nand \u20b93.1 lakh crore, respectively. The average daily net absorption under the LAF declined to \u20b92.9 lakh crore in August 2025 \nand \u20b91.6 lakh crore in September 2025 (up to 29th). \n18 In response to the cumulative policy repo rate cut of 100 basis points (bps) in the current easing cycle (up to September 29), \nthe WACR, the 3-month T-bill rate, the 3-month CP issued by NBFCs, and the 3-month CD rate declined by 92 bps, 105 bps, \n118 bps, and 147 bps, respectively. \n19 SCB Parameters: The outstanding credit and deposit increased by 10.4 per cent and 11.3 per cent on a y-o-y basis, \nrespectively, between June-24 and June-25. The system-level Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of 17.54 per cent \nin June 2025 was well above the regulatory minimum level. Ratio of non-performing loans improved further (GNPA ratio at 2.22 \nper cent in June 2025 vis-\u00e0-vis 2.67 per cent in June 2024, NNPA Ratio at 0.51 per cent in June 2025 vis-\u00e0-vis 0.60 per cent in \nJune 2024). Liquidity buffers were robust, with an LCR of 132.69 per cent as of end June 2025. The annualised return on assets \n(RoA) and return on equity (RoE) stood at 1.30 per cent and 13.02 per cent, respectively, in June 2025. Net Interest Margin was \n3.25 per cent for June 2025 (3.54 per cent in June 2024). \n \n20 NBFC Parameters: Total CRAR of NBFCs was 25.69 per cent and Tier I CRAR was 23.78 per cent in June 2025, well above \nthe minimum regulatory requirements. GNPA ratio has improved from 2.54 per cent in June 2024 to 2.23 per cent in June 2025, \nwhile NNPA ratio also improved from 1.07 per cent in June 2024 to 0.98 per cent in June 2025. RoA for the sector decreased \nslightly from 2.66 per cent in June 2024 to 2.64 per cent in June 2025. NIM has slightly decreased from 4.85% in June 2024 to \n4.50% in June 2025. \n \n5 \n \n18. \nBank credit growth, despite being lower than last year, continues to be healthy \nand supportive of real economic activity.21 I would like to emphasise here that, as \nother sources of funding are gradually but steadily increasing their footprint, it is the \noverall flow of financial resources to the economy that is more pertinent for assessing \nflow of funds to the productive sectors. The total flow of resources from non-bank \nsources to the commercial sector increased by \u20b92.66 lakh crore in 2025-26 so far, \nmore than offsetting the decline in non-food bank credit by \u20b90.48 lakh crore).22 \nAdditional Measures \n19. \nI shall now announce a package of twenty two additional measures aimed at \nstrengthening the resilience and competitiveness of the banking sector, improving the \nflow of credit, promoting ease of doing business, simplifying foreign exchange \nmanagement, enhancing consumer satisfaction, and internationalisation of Indian \nRupee.  \nStrengthening the resilience and competitiveness of the banking sector \n20. \nThere are four measures for strengthening the resilience and competitiveness \nof the Indian banks.  \n21. \nThe Expected Credit Loss (ECL) framework of provisioning with prudential \nfloors is proposed to be made applicable to all Scheduled Commercial Banks \n(excluding Small Finance Banks (SFBs), Payment Banks (PBs), Regional Rural \nBanks(RRBs)) and All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs) with effect from 1st April \n2027.  \n22. \nThey will be given a glide path (till March 31, 2031) to smoothen the one-time \nimpact of higher provisioning, if any, on their existing books.  \n23. \nFurther, it is proposed to make the revised Basel III capital adequacy norms \neffective for commercial banks (excluding SFBs, PBs and RRBs) from 1st April 2027.  \n24. \nIn furtherance of this, a draft of the Standardised Approach for Credit Risk \nshall be issued shortly. Under the revised approach, the proposed lower risk weights \non certain segments are expected to reduce the overall capital requirements, \nparticularly for MSMEs and residential real estate (including home loans).  \n25. \nIt may be recalled that capital requirements for operational risk have already \nbeen finalised (in 2023) whereas the capital requirements for market risk are under \nfinalisation after receipt of comments from the public. \n26. \n These measures will help align our guidelines with international standards \nadapted to our national conditions and priorities, and strengthen the capital adequacy \nframework for banks and AIFIs.  \n27. \nA draft circular on Forms of Business and Prudential Regulation for \nInvestments was issued in October, 2024. It has been finalised after public \nconsultations and will be issued shortly. The proposed regulatory restriction on \noverlap in the businesses undertaken by a bank and its group entity(ies) is being \nremoved from the final guidelines. The strategic allocation of business streams \namong group entities will be left to the wisdom of Bank Boards.  \n28. \nIt is further proposed to introduce risk-based deposit insurance premium with \nthe currently applicable flat rate of premium as the ceiling. This will incentivise sound \nrisk management by banks and reduce premium to be paid by better rated banks. \n \n21 Non-food bank credit recorded a year-on-year (y-o-y) growth of 10.2 per cent as on September 5, 2025, compared to 13.3 per \ncent a year ago. \n22 Among the non-bank sources, issuances of corporate bonds by non-financial entities increased by \u20b91.66 lakh crore while net \ninward FDI increased by \u20b90.93 lakh crore. \n6 \n \n \nImproving the flow of credit \n29. \nI will announce five measures to improve flow of credit.  \n30. \nOne, to expand the scope of capital market lending by banks, it is proposed to \nprovide an enabling framework for Indian banks to finance acquisitions by Indian \ncorporates.  \n31. \nTwo, it is proposed to (a) remove the regulatory ceiling on lending against \nlisted debt securities and (b) enhance limits for lending by banks against shares from \nRs. 20 lakh to Rs. 1 crore and for IPO financing from Rs. 10 lakh to Rs. 25 lakh per \nperson.  \n32. \nThree, it is proposed to withdraw the framework introduced in 2016 that \ndisincentivized lending by banks to specified borrowers (with credit limit from banking \nsystem of Rs.10,000 crore and above).  \n33. \nWhile the Large Exposure Framework since put in place for banks addresses \ncredit concentration risk to a particular entity or group at an individual bank-level, \nconcentration risk at the banking system level, as and when considered necessary, \nwill be managed through specific macroprudential tools.  \n34. \nFour, to reduce the cost of infrastructure financing by NBFCs, it is proposed to \nreduce the risk weights applicable to lending by NBFCs to operational, high quality \ninfrastructure projects.  \n35. \nFive, since 2004, licensing for Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) had been \npaused. Considering the positive developments in the sector during the last two \ndecades and in response to the growing demand from the stakeholders, we propose \nto publish a discussion paper on licensing of new UCBs. \nPromoting Ease of Doing Business \n36. \nI now come to measures related to EoDB. We have seven announcements \nincluding those related to FEMA.  \n37. \nFirst, a large number of circulars and directions totalling about 9000, have \nbeen consolidated, subject wise, across 11 types of regulated entities. Drafts of the \nsame shall be issued shortly for public consultation. \n38. \nSecond, it is proposed to provide greater flexibility to banks for opening and \nmaintaining transaction accounts of borrowers (viz. current accounts and CC/OD \naccounts). This will particularly help borrowers which are regulated by a financial \nsector regulator. Restrictions with respect to collection accounts are also proposed to \nbe withdrawn. \n39. \nThe export sector is a vital part of India\u2019s economy.  To further strengthen the \nsector and enhance ease of doing business, we shall: \n\u2022 a, extend the time period for repatriation from foreign currency accounts of \nIndian exporters in IFSC, from one month to three months.  \n\u2022 b, increase the period for forex outlay for Merchanting Trade transactions, \nfrom four months to six months; and \n\u2022  c, simplify the process of reconciliation of outstanding entries related to \nexports and imports in the respective reporting portals (EDPMS/IDPMS). \n \n \n \n7 \n \n \nSimplifying foreign exchange management \n40. \nSixth, key provisions relating to eligible borrowers, recognised lenders, limits \non borrowing, cost of borrowing, end-use and reporting, etc. in ECB regulations, \nissued under FEMA, are proposed to be rationalised. \n41. \nSeventh, it is proposed to rationalise FEMA regulations regarding non-\nresidents establishing their business presence in India. \nEnhancing consumer satisfaction \n42. \nI shall now state three consumer centric proposals: \n43. \nOne, the bouquet of services offered to Basic Savings Bank Deposit account \nholders without levy of minimum balance charges is proposed to be expanded to, \ninter alia, include digital banking (mobile/internet banking) services.  \n44. \nTwo, the Internal Ombudsman mechanism is proposed to be strengthened to \nmake grievance redressal by regulated entities more effective.  \n45. \nThree, the RBI Ombudsman Scheme is also being revised for improved \ngrievance redressal and rural cooperative banks are being included under the ambit \nof the Scheme. \nInternationalising Indian Rupee \n46. \nWe have been making steady progress in the use of Indian Rupee for \ninternational trade. Three measures are proposed in this regard: \n\u2022 First, permit AD banks to lend in Indian Rupees to non-residents from Bhutan, \nNepal and Sri Lanka for cross border trade transactions. \n\u2022 Second, establish transparent reference rates for currencies of India\u2019s major \ntrading partners to facilitate INR based transactions.  \n\u2022 Third, permit wider use of SRVA balances by making them eligible for \ninvestment in corporate bonds and commercial papers. \nConcluding Remarks \n47. \nLet me now conclude. Despite an external environment that has deteriorated \nsince the August policy, the Indian economy remains poised to register high growth. \nThe sobering of inflation has given greater leeway for monetary policy to support \ngrowth without compromising on the primary mandate of price stability. However, the \nMPC decided to wait for the cumulative impact of recent policy actions to play out \nbefore charting the next course of action. \n48. \nAs India strives towards achieving Viksit Bharat by the centenary year of its \nindependence, it would need the coordinated support of fiscal, monetary, regulatory \nand other public policies to attain its goal. The recent rationalisation of GST rates by \nthe Government is a major step in this direction. Our various policy announcements \ntoday will also support the achievement of this goal. In terms of monetary policy \nactions, we will remain vigilant of the incoming data and stay focussed on our \nobjective of maintaining price stability while supporting growth. In pursuit of this \nobjective, we will be proactive, objective and consistent in our communication while \nbacking it up with credible actions. \nThank you. Namaskar and Jai Hind. \n \n              (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1217                                            Chief General Manager \n",

    "file_extracted_text": "1 \n \n \nOctober 01, 2025 \nMonetary Policy Statement, 2025-26 \nResolution of the Monetary Policy Committee  \nSeptember 29 to October 1, 2025 \n \nMonetary Policy Decisions \n \n     The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held its 57th meeting from September 29 to \nOctober 1, 2025, under the chairmanship of Shri Sanjay Malhotra, Governor, Reserve \nBank of India. The MPC members Dr. Nagesh Kumar, Shri Saugata Bhattacharya, \nProf. Ram Singh, Dr. Poonam Gupta and Shri Indranil Bhattacharyya attended the \nmeeting. \n \n2. \n After a detailed assessment of the evolving macroeconomic and financial \ndevelopments and the outlook, the MPC voted unanimously to keep the policy repo \nrate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 5.50 per cent; \nconsequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains at 5.25 per cent while \nthe marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate remains at 5.75 per cent. \nThe MPC also decided to continue with the neutral stance.  \n \nGrowth and Inflation Outlook \n \n3. \nThe global economy has been more resilient than anticipated in 2025, with \nrobust growth in the US and China. The outlook, however, remains clouded amidst \nelevated policy uncertainty. Inflation has remained above their respective targets in \nsome advanced economies, posing fresh challenges for central banks as they \nnavigate the shifting growth-inflation dynamics. Financial markets have been volatile.  \nThe US dollar strengthened after the upward revision of US growth numbers for the \nsecond quarter, and treasury yields hardened recently tracking changes in policy rate \nexpectations. Equities have remained buoyant across several advanced and emerging \nmarket economies. \n  \n4. \nIn India, real gross domestic product (GDP), driven by strong private \nconsumption and fixed investment, recorded a robust growth of 7.8 per cent in \nQ1:2025-26. On the supply side, growth in gross value added (GVA) at 7.6 per cent \nwas led by a revival in manufacturing and steady expansion in services. Available high \nfrequency indicators suggest that economic activity continues to remain resilient. Rural \ndemand remains strong, riding on a good monsoon and robust agriculture activity, \nwhile urban demand is showing a gradual revival. Revenue expenditure of the Union \nand State Governments registered robust growth during the fiscal year so far (April-\nJuly). Investment activity, as suggested by healthy growth in construction indicators \ni.e., cement production and steel consumption in July-August, is holding up well even \nthough production and import of capital goods witnessed some moderation. Recovery \nin manufacturing sector continues while services activity is sustaining its momentum. \n   \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n5. \nLooking ahead, an above normal monsoon, good progress of kharif sowing and \nadequate reservoir levels have further brightened prospects of agriculture and rural \ndemand. Buoyancy in services sector coupled with steady employment conditions are \nsupportive of demand, which is expected to get a further boost from the rationalisation \nof goods and services tax (GST) rates. Rising capacity utilisation, conducive financial \nconditions, and improving domestic demand should continue to facilitate fixed \ninvestment. However, ongoing tariff and trade policy uncertainties will impact external \ndemand for goods and services. Prolonged geopolitical tensions and volatility in \ninternational financial markets caused by risk-off sentiments of investors also pose \ndownside risks to the growth outlook. The implementation of several growth-inducing \nstructural reforms, including streamlining of GST are expected to offset some of the \nadverse effects of the external headwinds. Taking all these factors into account, real \nGDP growth for 2025-26 is now projected at 6.8 per cent, with Q2 at 7.0 per cent, Q3 \nat 6.4 per cent, and Q4 at 6.2 per cent. Real GDP growth for Q1:2026-27 is projected \nat 6.4 per cent (Chart 1). The risks are evenly balanced. \n \n6. \nHeadline CPI inflation declined to its eight-year low of 1.6 per cent (y-o-y) in \nJuly 2025 before rising to 2.1 per cent in August \u2013 its first increase after nine months. \nBenign inflation conditions during 2025-26 so far have been primarily driven by a sharp \ndecline in food inflation from its peak of October 2024. Inflation within the fuel group \nmoved in a narrow range of 2.4-2.7 per cent during June-August. Core inflation \nremained largely contained at 4.2 per cent in August. Excluding precious metals, core \ninflation was at 3.0 per cent in August. \n \n7. \nIn terms of the inflation outlook for H2: 2025-26, healthy progress of the south-\nwest monsoon, higher kharif sowing, adequate reservoir levels and comfortable buffer \nstock of foodgrains should keep food prices benign. The recently implemented GST \nrate rationalisation would lead to a reduction in prices of several items in the CPI \nbasket. Overall, the inflation outcome is likely to be softer than what was projected in \nthe August MPC resolution, primarily on account of the GST rate cuts and benign food \nprices. Despite the anticipation of moderate momentum during H2, large unfavourable \nbase effects are likely to exert upward pressure on headline CPI inflation, especially \nin Q4. Considering all these factors, CPI inflation for 2025-26 is now projected at 2.6 \nper cent with Q2 at 1.8 per cent; Q3 at 1.8 per cent; and Q4 at 4.0 per cent. CPI \ninflation for Q1:2026-27 is projected at 4.5 per cent (Chart 2). The risks are evenly \nbalanced. \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nRationale for Monetary Policy Decisions \n \n8. \nThe MPC observed that the overall inflation outlook has turned even more \nbenign in the last few months, due to the reasons discussed above. The average \nheadline inflation for 2025-26 is now revised lower from 3.7 per cent and 3.1 per cent \nprojected in June and August policy, respectively, to 2.6 per cent. Headline inflation \nfor Q4:2025-26 and Q1:2026-27 too have been revised downwards and are broadly \naligned with the target, despite unfavourable base effects. Core inflation for this year \nand Q1:2026-27 is also expected to remain contained. \n \n9. \nGrowth outlook remains resilient supported by domestic drivers, despite weak \nexternal demand. It is likely to get further support from a favourable monsoon, lower \ninflation, monetary easing and the salubrious impact of recent GST reforms. However, \ngrowth continues to be below our aspirations. Even though the growth projection for \nthe financial year 2025-26 is being revised upwards, the forward-looking projections \nfor Q3 and beyond are expected to be slightly lower than projected earlier, primarily \ndue to tariff-related developments, despite being partially offset by the impetus \nprovided by the rationalisation of GST rates. \n \n10. \nTo summarize, there has been a significant moderation in inflation. Moreover, \nthe prevailing global uncertainties and tariff related developments are likely to \ndecelerate growth in H2:2025-26 and beyond. The current macroeconomic conditions \nand the outlook has opened up policy space for further supporting growth. However, \nthe MPC noted that the impact of the front-loaded monetary policy actions and the \nrecent fiscal measures is still playing out. The trade related uncertainties are also \nunfolding. The MPC, therefore, considered it prudent to wait for the impact of policy \nactions to play out and greater clarity to emerge before charting the next course of \naction. Accordingly, the MPC unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate \nunchanged at 5.5 per cent. The MPC also decided to retain the stance at neutral. \nHowever, two members - Dr. Nagesh Kumar and Prof. Ram Singh, were of the view \nthat the stance be changed from neutral to accommodative. \n \n11. \nThe minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on October 15, 2025. \n \n12. \nThe next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during December 3 to 5, 2025. \n \n \n \n                                                                                                    (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1216                                             Chief General Manager \n \n",

Similarly, the ratio of short-term debt (original maturity) to \nforeign exchange reserves decreased to 19.4 per cent at end-June 2025 (20.1 per \ncent at end-March 2025).  \n \n\u2022 Short-term debt on residual maturity basis (i.e., debt obligations that include long-\nterm debt by original maturity falling due over the next twelve months and short-\nterm debt by original maturity) constituted 40.7 per cent of total external debt at \nend-June 2025 (41.3 per cent at end-March 2025) and stood at 43.6 per cent of \nforeign exchange reserves (45.4 per cent at end-March 2025) (Table 2).  \n \n\u2022 US dollar-denominated debt remained the largest component of India\u2019s external \ndebt, with a share of 53.8 per cent at end-June 2025, followed by debt \ndenominated in the Indian rupee (30.6 per cent), yen (6.6 per cent), SDR (4.6 per \ncent), and euro (3.5 per cent). \n \n1 The concepts set out in the IMF\u2019s 2013 External Debt Statistics (EDS) Guide are \nharmonized with those of the System of National Accounts (SNA) 2008 and the sixth edition \nof the IMF\u2019s Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) \npublished in 2009. \n2 SDR: Special Drawing Rights. \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n\u2022 Outstanding debt of the general government decreased, while non-government \ndebt increased at end-June 2025 over end-March 2025 (Table 3). \n \n\u2022 The share of outstanding debt of non-financial corporations in total external debt \nwas the highest at 35.9 per cent, followed by deposit-taking corporations (except \nthe central bank) (27.4 per cent), general government (22.5 per cent) and other \nfinancial corporations (9.5 per cent). \n \n\u2022 Loans remained the largest component of external debt, with a share of 34.8 per \ncent, followed by currency and deposits (23.0 per cent), trade credit and \nadvances (17.7 per cent) and debt securities (16.8 per cent) (Table 4). \n \n\u2022 Debt service (i.e., principal repayments and interest payments) stood at 6.6 per \ncent of current receipts at end-June 2025, same as end-March 2025 (Table 5). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1208                                             Chief General Manager \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nTable 1: External Debt \u2013 Outstanding and Variation \n(US$ billion, unless indicated otherwise) \nSector \nOutstanding as at end  \nof \nAbsolute \nVariation \nPercentage \nVariation \nJune \n2024 \nPR \nMarch \n2025 \nPR \nJune \n2025 \nP \nJune \n2025 \nover \nJune \n2024 \nJune \n2025 \nover \nMarch \n2025 \nJune \n2025 \nover \nJune \n2024 \nJune \n2025 \nover \nMarch \n2025 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \nI.

    "file_extracted_text": " September 30, 2025 \n \nRevised Liquidity Management Framework \n \n     The report of the Internal Working Group (IWG) to review the Liquidity \nManagement Framework was placed on the RBI website on August 6, 2025, and \ncomments on the same were invited from stakeholders and members of the public by \nAugust 29, 2025. The Reserve Bank has received comments from various \nstakeholders. \n \n2. Based on the recommendations of the IWG and after considering the feedback \nreceived, the liquidity management framework has been finalised as under: \n \ni. \nThe overnight weighted average call rate (WACR) will continue to be the \noperating target of the monetary policy. The Reserve Bank will, however, \ncontinue to keep track of rates in other overnight money market segments to \nensure orderly evolution of money market rates and smoothen transmission. \nii. \nThe existing symmetric corridor system is retained, with policy repo rate at the \nmiddle of the corridor and standing deposit facility (SDF) and marginal \nstanding facility (MSF), which are 25 bps on either side of the policy repo rate, \nacting as the lower bound (floor) and upper bound (ceiling) of the corridor, \nrespectively. \niii. \nThe Reserve Bank will endeavour to align the WACR to the policy repo rate by \nensuring optimum level of system liquidity using the instruments defined under \nthis framework. \niv. \nThe 14-day variable rate repo (VRR)/ variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) \noperation will be discontinued as the main operation for managing short-\nterm/transient liquidity. Instead, the same will be managed primarily through 7-\nday VRR/ VRRR and other VRR/VRRR operations of tenors from overnight up \nto 14 days, at the discretion of the Reserve Bank based on its assessment of \nthe system liquidity requirement. \nv. \nTo reduce uncertainty in the market about the tenor, quantum and timing of \nthe repo/reverse repo operations, the Reserve Bank will provide sufficient \nadvance notice to market participants, at least by one day, while conducting \nany such liquidity operation. However, when circumstances warrant, the \nReserve Bank would conduct operations by announcing on the same day. \nvi. \nInstruments under the extant liquidity management framework for managing \ndurable liquidity viz. open market operations (OMOs), long-term variable rate \nrepo/reverse repo operations and forex swap auctions will continue to be part \nof the revised liquidity management framework. \nvii. \nThe current requirement of maintaining a minimum of 90 per cent of the \nprescribed CRR on a daily basis will continue. \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \nviii. \nStandalone Primary Dealers (SPDs) will have access to SDF, overnight \nreverse repo operations, and all repo operations, irrespective of their tenor. \n \n3.

While three of these amendments come into effect \nimmediately (Part A), public comments are solicited on the other four (Part B).  \nDetails of the proposals are given below. \nA. Directions which come into force from October 01, 2025 \n1. Reserve Bank of India (Interest Rate on Advances) (Amendment \nDirections), 2025 \n     In terms of the extant Reserve Bank of India (Interest Rate on Advances) \nDirections, 2016 dated March 3, 2016, scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) are \nrequired to benchmark all floating rate personal or retail loans (housing, auto, \netc.), and floating rate loans extended to MSMEs, to an external benchmark. \nWhile banks are free to decide the spread over the external benchmark, other \nthan credit risk premium, all components of the spread can be altered only once \nin three years. Further, in respect of Equated Monthly Instalments (EMI) based \nPersonal Loans, the Circular on Reset of Floating Interest Rate on EMI based \nPersonal Loans dated August 18, 2023, requires the regulated entities to provide \na mandatory option to the borrowers, at the time of reset of interest rates, to \nswitch over to a fixed rate.  \n     Vide the above Amendment Directions, it is proposed to revise the above \nprovisions to benefit the borrowers, while providing greater flexibility to the \nlenders.  \n(i) Banks may reduce the other spread components for the benefit of the \nborrower earlier than three years; \n \n \n \n2 \n(ii) Banks may, at their discretion, provide the option to switchover to fixed rate \nat the time of reset at their discretion. \n2. Reserve Bank of India (Lending Against Gold and Silver Collateral) - \n(1st Amendment) Directions, 2025 \n     Banks are generally prohibited from lending for purchase of gold/silver in any \nform, or lending against the security of primary gold/silver. However, a carve-out \nhas been allowed for scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) for granting working \ncapital loans to jewellers.  \nVide the proposed Amendment Directions, it is proposed to: \n(i) \nExtend the carve-out for granting any need-based working capital \nrequirements of a borrower that uses gold as a raw material or input in \nits manufacturing or industrial processing activities.  \n(ii) \nPermit Tier 3 and Tier 4 Urban Co-operative Banks to also grant \nworking capital loans, on the same lines as proposed for SCBs. \n     The above instructions shall be duly incorporated under the Reserve Bank of \nIndia (Lending Against Gold and Silver Collateral) Directions, 2025. \n3. Reserve Bank of India (Basel III Capital Regulations - Perpetual Debt \nInstruments (PDI) in Additional Tier 1 Capital \u2013 Eligible Limit for \nInstruments Denominated in Foreign Currency/Rupee Denominated \nBonds Overseas) Directions, 2025 \n     The \nReserve \nBank \nhad \nissued \na \ncircular \nDOR.CAP.REC.No.56/21.06.201/2021-22 dated October 4, 2021 on \u201cBasel III \nCapital Regulations - Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI) in Additional Tier 1 \nCapital \u2013 Eligible Limit for Instruments Denominated in Foreign Currency/Rupee \nDenominated Bonds Overseas\u201d, applicable to Scheduled Commercial Banks \n(excluding Regional Rural Banks), which specifies the eligible limit for PDIs \ndenominated in foreign currency/rupee denominated bonds overseas. The said \ninstructions have also been incorporated in sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph 1.16 \nof Annex 4 to the Master Circular DOR.CAP.REC.2/21.06.201/2025-26 dated \nApril 1, 2025 on \u201cBasel III Capital Regulations\u201d.  \n \n \n \n3 \n     The Reserve Bank has today released the \u201cReserve Bank of India (Basel III \nCapital Regulations - Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI) in Additional Tier 1 \nCapital \u2013 Eligible Limit for Instruments Denominated in Foreign Currency/Rupee \nDenominated Bonds Overseas) Directions, 2025\u201d, which revises the existing \neligible limit applicable to PDIs denominated in foreign currency/rupee \ndenominated bonds overseas, thereby providing greater headroom to banks for \naugmenting their Tier 1 capital via overseas markets. \nB. Directions/Circulars which are being issued as drafts for public \nfeedback  \n4.  Reserve Bank of India (Gold Metal Loans) Directions, 2025 \n     The Gold Metal Loan (GML) scheme was introduced vide circular on \u2018Gold \nLoan\u2019 dated December 31, 1998 to facilitate working capital finance to jewellery \nexporters in the form of raw gold imported by banks. The scheme has been \nliberalised over the years by, inter alia, allowing banks to extend GML to domestic \njewellery manufacturers and also from the gold deposits mobilised under the Gold \nMonetization Scheme. \n     With a view to further liberalise the scheme, harmonize the extant regulations \napplicable across eligible borrower segments in jewellery industry and provide \nmore operational freedom to banks to devise their GML policy, a draft of \ncomprehensive set of Directions on GML is being issued. The draft Directions, \napart from making the same more principle-based, cover the following key \nmodifications in the existing GML scheme: \n(i) Banks may fix a repayment tenor for GML extended to jewellers other than \nexporters, subject to a revised ceiling of 270 days (from current 180 days); \n(ii) Extant guidelines allow extension of GML to jewellery exporters and domestic \njewellery manufacturers. It is proposed to allow GML to domestic non-\nmanufacturers as well, for outsourcing their manufacturing of jewellery. \n \n \n \n4 \n5. Large Exposures Framework (Amendment Circular), 2025; and \nGuidelines on Management of Intragroup Transactions and Exposures \n(Amendment Circular), 2025 \n     Circulars on Large Exposures Framework (LEF) dated June 3, 2019, Large \nExposures Framework \u2013 Credit Risk Mitigation (CRM) for offsetting \u2013 non-\ncentrally cleared derivative transactions of foreign bank branches in India with \ntheir Head Office (LEF-CRM) dated September 9, 2021, and Guidelines on \nManagement of Intra-Group Transactions and Exposures (ITE) dated February \n11, 2014 prescribe prudential norms on a bank\u2019s exposures to its counterparties \nas also those to its group entities.  \n     The two Amendment Circulars amend the extant norms to clarify certain \naspects on prudential treatment of exposures of foreign bank operating as \nbranches in India and aligning some of the prudential norms under LEF and ITE. \nThe key changes include the following: \n(i) \nExposure of Indian branches of foreign banks to their HO, and \nbranches/subsidiaries of the HO, shall be reckoned only for LEF, and \nnot ITE. Such exposures, where cleared through a central \ncounterparty, shall be considered on a gross basis.  \n(ii) \nFunds received from the HO, and kept by the Indian branch of a foreign \nbank under a special arrangement with RBI as cash/unencumbered \napproved securities, are treated as CRM for offsetting non-centrally \ncleared derivative transactions of such branches with their HO. It is \nproposed to extend the CRM benefit to any exposure of a foreign bank \nbranch to its HO.  \n(iii) \nComputation of exposure under ITE is proposed to be made consistent \nwith those under LEF i.e., the benefit of credit conversion factor for \ndeciding credit equivalence of off-balance sheet exposures, and credit \nrisk mitigation technique for offsetting exposures to a counterparty, \nshall henceforth be permitted for ITE exposures.  \n(iv) \nThe ITE threshold, which is currently linked to Paid-up Capital and \nReserves, is proposed to be linked to Tier-1 capital of banks.  \n \n \n \n5 \n6. Draft Reserve Bank of India (Credit Information Reporting) (1st \nAmendment) Directions, 2025 \n     The Master Direction \u2013 Reserve Bank of India (Credit Information Reporting) \nDirections, 2025 mandates submission of credit information by Credit Institutions \n(CIs) to Credit Information Companies (CICs) at fortnightly or shorter intervals. \nGiven the increasing reliance of CIs on credit information reports in credit \nunderwriting processes, it is imperative that the credit information reports (CIR) \nprovided by CICs reflect a more recent information. Accordingly, the provisions \nof the Master Direction \u2013 Reserve Bank of India (Credit Information Reporting) \nDirections, 2025 pertaining to frequency of reporting of credit information by CIs \nto CICs have been reviewed. \n     It is proposed to transition to weekly credit information submission by CIs to \nCICs. The Draft amendments also mandate measures to facilitate faster data \nsubmission and error rectification by the CIs. Further, to facilitate aggregation of \ncredit information by CICs, it is proposed to capture Central Know Your Customer \n(CKYC) number in a separate field in the reporting format of consumer segment. \n \n \n \n     The comments on the draft Directions/Circulars are invited from the banks, \nmarket participants, and other interested parties till October 20, 2025. The \ncomments/ feedback may be submitted through the link under the \u2018Connect 2 \nRegulate\u2019 Section available on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website. Comments may \nalternatively be forwarded to The Chief General Manager-in-Charge, Department \nof Regulation, Central Office Reserve Bank of India, 12th/ 13th Floor Shahid \nBhagat Singh Marg, Fort Mumbai \u2013 400 001 or by email.  \n \n \n                                                                                          (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1197                                     Chief General Manager \n \n \n \n",

    "file_extracted_text": " \n September 29, 2025 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on Beed District Central Co-operative Bank Ltd., \nMaharashtra \n \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBl) has imposed, by an order dated September 25, \n2025, a monetary penalty of \u20b92.25 lakh (Rupees Two Lakh Twenty Five Thousand \nonly) on Beed District Central Co-operative Bank Ltd., Maharashtra (the bank) for \ncontravention of provisions of Section 26A read with Section 56 of the Banking \nRegulation Act, 1949 (BR Act) and non-compliance with certain directions issued by \nRBI on \u2018Membership of Credit Information Companies (CICs) by Co-operative Banks\u2019 \nand \u2018Know Your Customer (KYC)\u2019. This penalty has been imposed in exercise of \npowers conferred on RBI under the provisions of section 47A(1)(c) read with Sections \n46(4)(i) and 56 of the BR Act and Section 25 of the Credit Information Companies \n(Regulation) Act, 2005. \n \n     The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by the National Bank for \nAgriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), with reference to its financial position \nas on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of contravention of statutory \nprovisions / non-compliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that \nregard, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty \nshould not be imposed on it for its failure to comply with the said provisions and \ndirections. After considering the bank's reply to the notice, additional submissions \nmade by it and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter \nalia, that the following charges against the bank were sustained, warranting \nimposition of monetary penalty: \n \nThe bank had: \ni) failed to transfer eligible unclaimed amounts to the Depositor Education and \nAwareness Fund within the prescribed time; \nii) failed to submit credit information of its customers to all the four CICs; and \niii) failed to undertake requisite Customer Due Diligence (CDD) procedure while \nestablishing account-based relationship in certain accounts. \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \nbank with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n               (Puneet Pancholy)   \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1194                                             Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
