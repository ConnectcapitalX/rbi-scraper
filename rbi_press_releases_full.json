    "file_extracted_text": " \n June 30, 2025 \n \nRBI releases the Financial Stability Report, June 2025 \n    \n     Today, the Reserve Bank released the June 2025 issue of the Financial Stability \nReport (FSR), which reflects the collective assessment of the Sub-Committee of the \nFinancial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) on the resilience of the Indian \nfinancial system and risks to financial stability. \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 \nElevated economic and trade policy uncertainties are testing the resilience of \nthe global economy and the financial system. \n\u2022 \nFinancial markets remain volatile, especially core government bond markets, \ndriven by shifting policy and geopolitical environment. Alongside, existing \nvulnerabilities such as soaring public debt levels and elevated asset valuations \nhave the potential to amplify fresh shocks. \n\u2022 \nDespite an uncertain and challenging global economic backdrop, the Indian \neconomy remains a key driver of global growth, underpinned by sound \nmacroeconomic fundamentals and prudent macroeconomic policies. \n\u2022 \nThe domestic financial system is exhibiting resilience fortified by healthy \nbalance sheets of banks and non-banks. Financial conditions have eased \nsupported by accommodative monetary policy and low volatility in financial \nmarkets. The strength of the corporate balance sheets also lends support to \noverall macroeconomic stability. \n\u2022 \nThe soundness and resilience of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) are \nbolstered by robust capital buffers, multi-decadal low non-performing loans \nratio and strong earnings.  \n\u2022 \nResults of macro stress tests affirm that most SCBs have adequate capital \nbuffers relative to the regulatory minimum even under adverse stress \nscenarios. Stress tests also validate the resilience of mutual funds and \nclearing corporations. \n\u2022 \nNon-banking financial companies (NBFCs) remain healthy with sizable capital \nbuffers, robust earnings and improving asset quality. \n\u2022 \nThe consolidated solvency ratio of the insurance sector also remains above \nthe minimum threshold limit. \n \n \n \n          (Puneet Pancholy)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/624                                          Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
