NSFI: 2025-30 emphasises a synergistic ecosystem approach, improving the \nquality and consistency of last mile access and effective usage of financial services. \nIt lays down five strategic objectives (Panch-Jyoti) towards elevating the state of \nfinancial inclusion in the country and a menu of 47 action points to achieve them. The \nPanch Jyoti are: \n \ni) improving the availability and use of equitable, responsible, suitable, and \naffordable bouquet of financial services to achieve financial safety and \nfinancial security for households and micro enterprises, \nii) adopting gender-sensitive approach for women-led financial inclusion and \ndifferentiated strategies for improving financial resilience of households, \nespecially for the underserved and vulnerable segments, \niii) synergizing livelihood, skill development and support ecosystem and its \nlinkages with financial inclusion, \niv) leveraging financial education as a tool for promoting financial discipline, and \nv) strengthening the quality and reliability of customer protection and grievance \nredressal measures. \n \n3. The Strategy has been framed under the aegis of Technical Group on Financial \nInclusion and Financial Literacy (TGFIFL) following country-wide discussions with  \nvarious stakeholders by the RBI and consultations involving the Department of \nEconomic Affairs and Department of Financial Services, Ministry of Finance, \nGovernment of India, Securities and Exchange Board of India, Insurance Regulatory \nand Development Authority of India, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development \nAuthority, National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, National Skill \nDevelopment Corporation, and National Centre for Financial Education. \n \n4. The five-year period covered under the earlier Strategy viz., NSFI: 2019-2024, had \nwitnessed significant improvements across the access, usage, and quality \ndimensions of financial inclusion. NSFI: 2025-30 envisages consolidation of these \nachievements and further advancement of the objectives of financial inclusion. \n \n \n \n \n               (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1596                                      Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

    "file_extracted_text": " \nNovember 28, 2025 \n \nReserve Bank of India issues Consolidated Master Directions \n \n     The Reserve Bank has issued numerous directions over the years, under the \nstatutory powers conferred upon it by various Acts. While increase in regulatory \nguidelines is a natural process as the financial system evolves, this was further \ndriven by an expanding regulatory perimeter, distributed supervisory/ regulatory \njurisdiction over certain regulated entities, and non-repeal of some of the earlier \ninstructions when new ones were issued. Being mindful of compliance burden to the \nRegulated Entities (REs), the Reserve Bank has continuously endeavoured to \noptimise its regulatory framework. \n \n2. Against this backdrop, the Reserve Bank has recently undertaken a fundamental \nreorganisation of the regulatory instructions administered by its Department of \nRegulation \u2013 marking a paradigm shift in its regulatory communication. The \ncomprehensive exercise involved consolidation of more than 9000 existing circular/ \nguidelines administered by Department of Regulation into 238 function-wise Master \nDirections (MDs), specific to each category of regulated entity. Instructions issued by \nNABARD to Regional Rural Banks, State Co-operative Banks and Central Co-\noperative Banks were also consolidated in consultation with NABARD. This exercise \nis expected to enhance clarity, ease of access, and reduce compliance burden for \nREs, thereby supporting the broader objective of improving ease of doing business. \n \n3. Under this consolidation effort, instructions contained in approximately 3500 \ndirections, circulars, and guidelines, were consolidated into 238 Master Directions, \nacross 11 types of regulated entities. For this purpose, the 11 types of regulated \nentities identified are: (a) Commercial Banks; (b) Small Finance Banks; (c) Payments \nBanks; (d) Local Area Banks; (e) Regional Rural Banks; (f) Urban Co-operative \nBanks; (g) Rural Co-operative Banks; (h) All India Financial Institutions; (i) Non-\nBanking Financial Companies; (j) Asset Reconstruction Companies; and (k) Credit \nInformation Companies. Instructions contained in remaining directions / circulars \nwere identified as obsolete and marked for repeal once the consolidated MDs are \nissued. \n \n4. Accordingly, the drafts of these 238 MDs were placed on website of the Reserve \nBank for public comments regarding completeness and accuracy vide press release \ndated October 10, 2025. The list of circulars that were proposed to be repealed \nfollowing the issue of consolidated MDs as well as a list of notifications that were to \nbe retained as standalone were also provided. \n \n5. The Reserve Bank had received over 770 comments from various stakeholders on \nthe draft MDs. Several suggestions were for regulatory changes, which were outside \nthe scope of this consolidation exercise, and hence have not been considered for the \npurpose of consolidation. The remaining comments, relevant to the finalisation of the \nMDs have been duly considered while finalising the consolidated MDs. \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n6.

    "file_extracted_text": " \nNovember 28, 2025 \n \nRBI imposes monetary penalty on Mannakrishna Investments Private Limited \n \n     The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated November 25, 2025, \nimposed a monetary penalty of \u20b93.10 lakh (Rupees Three lakh ten thousand only) on \nMannakrishna Investments Private Limited (the company) for non-compliance with \ncertain provisions of the \u2018Master Direction \u2013 Reserve Bank of India (Non-Banking \nFinancial Company - Scale Based Regulation) Directions, 2023\u2019 issued by RBI, \nrelating to \u2018Governance Issues\u2019. This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers \nconferred on RBI under clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 58G read with clause \n(aa) of sub-section (5) of Section 58B of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.  \n \n     The statutory inspection of the company was conducted by RBI with reference to \nits financial position as on March 31, 2024. Based on the supervisory findings of non-\ncompliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice \nwas issued to the company advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be \nimposed on it for failure to comply with the said directions. \n \n     After considering the company\u2019s reply to the notice and oral submissions made \nduring the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charge against \nthe company was sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: \n \n     The company had failed to take prior written permission of the RBI while \nappointing a director resulting in change in management on account of change in \nmore than 30 per cent of its directors, excluding independent directors.  \n \n     This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended \nto pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the \ncompany with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the company. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                      (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1586                                             Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

This penalty has been imposed in exercise of \npowers conferred on RBI under the provisions of section 47A(1)(c) read with section \n46(4)(i) of the BR Act. \n     The Statutory Inspection for Supervisory Evaluation (ISE 2024) of the bank was \nconducted by RBI with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2024. \nBased on supervisory findings of non-compliance with the provisions of BR Act, RBI \ndirections and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the bank \nadvising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure \nto comply with the said provisions of BR Act and RBI directions.  \n     After considering the bank\u2019s reply to the notice and additional submissions made \nby it, RBI found that the following charges against the bank were sustained, \nwarranting imposition of monetary penalty: \ni) The bank had adopted multiple benchmarks within the same loan category; \nii) A wholly owned subsidiary of the bank undertook business which is not a \npermissible business that can be undertaken by a banking company under \nSection 6 of the BR Act; and \niii) The bank had outsourced the function of determining compliance with KYC \nnorms of certain customers to its outsourcing agents. \n     This action is based on deficiencies in statutory and regulatory compliance and is \nnot intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered \ninto by the bank with its customers. Further, imposition of monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n                     (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1580                                             Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u012f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",

State of the Economy; II. \u2018Making the Horizons Meet\u2019: A \nHeterodox Approach for Short-Term Inflation Forecasting; III. Multivariate Core Trend \nInflation: A New Measure of Core Inflation; IV. Nowcasting GDP in India: A New \nApproach; and V. Seasonality in Key Economic Indicators of India. \n \nI. \nState of the Economy \n \n     Global uncertainty remains elevated, although October witnessed a slight pullback \nafter more than a year of continuous increase. Concerns persist about the heightened \nexuberance in global equity markets, raising questions about its sustainability and its \nimplications for financial stability. The Indian economy showed signs of a further pick \nup in momentum, despite continuing global headwinds. Available high-frequency \nindicators for October suggest a robust expansion in both manufacturing and services \nactivities, supported by festive season demand and the ongoing positive impact of the \nGST reforms. Inflation has moderated to a historic low and remained well below the \ntarget rate. Financial conditions remained benign, and the flow of financial resources \nto the commercial sector increased significantly from a year ago. \n \nII. \n\u2018Making the Horizons Meet\u2019: A Heterodox Approach for Short-Term \nInflation Forecasting \n \nBy Joice John, Saquib Hasan, Renjith Mohan and Suvendu Sarkar \n \n     This article presents a framework for short-term inflation forecasts integrating three \ndiverse procedures: (i) nowcasts (ii) machine learning and statistical methods and (iii) \nsystem of dynamic and stochastic equations, allowing nowcasts in the near end of the \nhorizon to converge to a benchmark forecast. \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 By integrating nowcasts (generated using full-information matrix), benchmark \nforecasts (estimated using machine learning and statistical models), seasonal \nfactors and judgmental adjustments into a dynamic system of disaggregated \ncomponent/sub-group level equations, the proposed framework offers a forward-\nlooking and granular view of inflation dynamics.  \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n2 \n \n\u2022 Pseudo-out of sample root mean square error (RMSE) for year-on-year headline \ninflation is markedly lower in the near-term compared to benchmark forecasts and \nas the horizon extends, it converges to that of the benchmark forecasts. Thus, the \nproposed framework leverages the advantage of nowcasts in the near-term, while \nensuring enhanced forecast accuracy in the shorter horizon. \n\u2022 As such, the forecasting framework provides a powerful, yet pragmatic approach \nfor generating short-term inflation forecasts in an increasingly complex and \nuncertain environment faced by emerging market economies.  \n \nIII. \nMultivariate Core Trend Inflation: A New Measure of Core Inflation \n \nBy Harendra Kumar Behera and Abhishek Ranjan \n  \n     The Multivariate Core Trend (MCT) inflation is a measure of trend inflation which \nprovides insight on whether the inflation dynamics are dominated by a trend common \nacross sectors or are sector-specific, and it has been developed to track persistent \nprice pressures in the economy. The measure looks beyond temporary price swings \nin food and fuel and focuses on lasting inflation trends, making it useful for policy \nassessment. \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 MCT inflation shows greater stability and smoother movements compared to \nheadline and conventional core inflation, especially during periods of large supply \nshocks such as the pandemic and the surge in global commodity prices. \n\u2022 Broad-based price pressures, rather than isolated sector movements, have been \nthe key drivers of underlying inflation in recent years, with services inflation gaining \nimportance. \n\u2022 The new measure improves inflation forecasting over the medium term, offering \npolicymakers an additional tool to monitor inflation dynamics and support decision-\nmaking. \n \nIV. \nNowcasting GDP in India: A New Approach \n \nBy Indrajit Roy and K. M. Neelima \n \n     To gauge the underlying state of the economy, central banks and policy makers \noften track high frequency indicators. In this context, nowcasting has become a useful \ntool for policymakers for summarising the information flowing from different indicators, \nespecially for tracking macroeconomic variables like gross domestic product (GDP) \nfor which data are often released with considerable lags. In this article, a novel two-\nstep approach for nowcasting GDP has been proposed. \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 A primary composite index (PCI) is constructed using selected indicators based on \nthe strength of each indicator in relation to the target variable, i.e, GDP, and a \nsecondary composite index (SCI) is built from the residual information of the \nindicators which are otherwise generally discarded. PCI and SCI are then jointly \nused to nowcast GDP. \n\u2022 The novelty of the new approach lies in i) assigning more weightage to the \nindicators that are correlated with the target series rather than co-movement of the \n3 \n \nindicators among themselves, and ii) maximising information by utilising \ninformation which are often discarded by the conventional modelling process by \ncreating a secondary information source based on residuals. \n\u2022 Incorporating secondary information from residuals has greatly improved accuracy \nof nowcasting GDP when compared with the baseline single-step nowcasting using \ndynamic factor-based modelling (DFM). \n \nV. \nSeasonality in Key Economic Indicators of India \n \nBy Souvik Ghosh, Shivangee Misra, Anirban Sanyal and Sanjay Singh \n \n     This article unveils the seasonal patterns in key economic indicators for India, \nanalysing 78 monthly indicators across six major sectors\u2014monetary and banking, \npayment systems, prices, industrial production, merchandise trade and services\u2014\nalong with 25 quarterly indicators spanning national accounts, balance of payments, \ncapacity utilisation of Indian manufacturing companies and forward-looking enterprise \nsurveys. \n \nHighlights: \n \n\u2022 Banking monthly indicators such as, bank credit, non-food credit and demand \ndeposits typically reach their year-end peak in March.  \n\u2022 Consumer price index experiences seasonal pressure from July to November, \nprimarily due to rising vegetable prices during the monsoon, while fruit prices tend \nto peak in the summer.  \n\u2022 In industrial production, most items hit their highest levels in March, except \nconsumer durables, which peak in October during the festive season. \n\u2022 Both exports and imports reach their seasonal highs in March, with exports \nshowing more pronounced seasonal fluctuations than imports. \n\u2022 Real gross domestic product and gross value added consistently peak in Q4 \n(January-March), with higher seasonal variations since the pandemic. \n\u2022 Private final consumption expenditure and gross fixed capital formation trough in \nQ2 (July-September), whereas government final consumption expenditure \nexperiences seasonal low in Q3 (October-December). Within supply side, \nagriculture experiences maximum seasonal variations. \n\u2022 In the Reserve Bank\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey, manufacturers\u2019 current \nassessment peaks during Q4 (January-March) and expectations scales seasonal \nmaximum in Q3 (October-December). \n\u2022 Services exports peak in Q4, while exports of telecommunications, computer and \ninformation services are strongest in Q3. \n \n    The views expressed in the Bulletin articles are of the authors and do not represent \nthe views of the Reserve Bank of India. \n               \n \n \n               (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1561                                       Chief General Manager \n \n",

Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without \nprejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                    (Brij Raj)  \n \nPress Release: 2025-2026/1555                                           Chief General Manager \n\u1ba7\u0947\u0938 \u1ba7\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE \n \n                                                       \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u1cef\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u1c79\u0915 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n \n0\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0907\u091f : www.rbi.org.in/hindi \n\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u1c76\u1ba4\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u1cf2\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \nWebsite : www.rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Communication, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \n\u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932/email : helpdoc@rbi.org.in \nMumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 \n",
