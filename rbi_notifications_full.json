Introduction  \nAll digital payment transactions in India are required to meet the norm of two factors of \nauthentication. While no specific factor was mandated for authentication, the digital \npayments ecosystem has primarily adopted SMS-based One Time Password (OTP) as \nthe additional factor.    \nAs announced in Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies dated February \n08, 2024, in order to enable the payments ecosystem to leverage the technological \nadvancements for implementing alternative authentication mechanisms, it has been \ndecided to publish Reserve Bank of India (Authentication mechanisms for digital \npayment transactions) Directions, 2025 (hereinafter referred to as \u201cDirections\u201d). \nThe directions provide the broad principles which shall be complied with by all the \nparticipants in the payment chain, while using a form of authentication. \nWhile these directions are applicable only to domestic transactions, in order to provide a \nsimilar level of safety for online international transactions undertaken using cards issued \nin India, the directions also incorporate necessary instructions for specific cross-border \ncard transactions, in line with the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies \ndated February 07, 2025.  \nThese directions are issued under Section 18 read with Section 10(2) of the Payment and \nSettlement Systems (PSS) Act, 2007 (Act 51 of 2007). \n2. Short title  \nThese directions shall be called Reserve Bank of India (Authentication mechanisms \nfor digital payment transactions) Directions, 2025 \n3. Effective Date \nAll Payment System Providers and Payment System Participants, including banks and \nnon-bank entities, shall ensure compliance with these directions by April 01, 2026, \nunless indicated otherwise for any specific provision herein. \nPage 1 of 7 \n \n \n4. Applicability\na. These directions shall be applicable to all Payment System Providers and Payment\nSystem Participants (banks and non-banks).\nb. These directions apply to all domestic digital payment transactions, unless\nspecifically exempted otherwise.\n5. Definitions\nI.\nUnless the context otherwise requires, the following terms shall bear the meanings\nassigned to them as below:\na.\nAuthentication: Process of validating and confirming the credentials of the\ncustomer who is originating the payment instruction.\nb.\nCard Not Present (CNP) transaction: A transaction where the card and\nacceptance infrastructure are not present in close proximity while making the\ntransaction.\nc.\nCard Present transaction: A transaction that is carried out through the\nphysical use of card at the point of transaction.\nd.\nCross-border CNP transaction: A payment instruction wherein the card,\nissued by an Indian issuer, is used for undertaking a payment transaction\nfavouring a merchant acquired by an overseas acquirer. For such\ntransactions, outflow of foreign exchange is envisaged.\ne.\nDigital Payment Transaction shall have the same meaning as \u201cElectronic\nFunds Transfer\u201d as defined in the PSS Act, 2007.\nf.\nFactor of Authentication: Credential of the customer which is used for\nauthentication. The factors of authentication can be from \u201csomething the user\nhas\u201d, \u201csomething the user knows\u201d or \u201csomething the user is\u201d and may\ncomprise, inter-alia, password, SMS based OTP, passphrase, PIN, card\nhardware, software token, fingerprint, or any other form of biometrics (device\nnative or Aadhaar based).\nPage 2 of 7 \n \ng. Issuer: A bank or a non-bank that maintains the customer\u2019s account from \nwhich payment is made, such as a deposit account or a credit line or a \nprepaid instrument.  \nII. \nWords and expressions used but not defined in these directions and defined in \nthe PSS Act, 2007 shall have the meanings assigned to them in that Act. \n \n6. Principles for authentication of digital payment transactions \nThe technology and process deployed for authenticating a payment instruction by the \nPayment System Provider / Payment System Participant(s) shall comply with the \nfollowing principles: \na. Minimum two factors of authentication \nAll digital payment transactions shall be authenticated by at least two distinct factors \nof authentication as defined in paragraph-5(f), unless exempted.  The list of exemptions \nwhich are currently in force are listed in Annexure-1.  \nNote - Issuers may, at their discretion, offer a choice of authentication factors to their \ncustomers in compliance with these directions.  \nb. At least one of the factors to be dynamic  \nIt shall be ensured that for digital payment transactions, other than card present \ntransactions, at least one of the factors of authentication is dynamically created or \nproven, i.e., the proof of possession of the factor, being sent as part of the transaction, \nis unique to that transaction. \n \nc. Robust \nThe factor of authentication shall be such that compromise of one factor does not affect \nreliability of the other.  \n \n \nPage 3 of 7 \n \n \n \n \n7. Interoperability / Open Access  \nSystem Providers and System Participants shall offer authentication or tokenisation \nservice that is accessible to all the applications / token requestors functioning in that \noperating environment for all use cases / channels or token storage mechanisms. \nNote \u2013  \ni. \nOperating environment includes device hardware, operating system, etc.  \nii. \nThe terms, \u2018tokenisation\u2019,\u2018token requestor\u2019, \u2018use cases/channels\u2019 and \u2018token \nstorage mechanisms\u2019 shall have the same meaning as assigned to them in \nthe RBI directions on \u201cTokenisation \u2013 Card Transactions\u201d dated  \nJanuary 08, 2019, as amended from time to time. \n8. Risk based approach \nIssuers may, in line with their internal risk management policies, identify transactions \nfor evaluation against behavioural / contextual parameters such as transaction \nlocation, user behaviour patterns, device attributes, historical transaction profile, \netc.  Based on the perceived risk associated with the transaction, additional checks \nbeyond the minimum two-factor authentication may be resorted to. Issuers may also \nexplore using DigiLocker as a platform for notification and confirmation for high-risk \ntransactions. \n9. Responsibility of the issuer  \na. An issuer shall ensure the robustness and integrity of the authentication \nmechanism before deployment.  \nb. If any loss arises out of transactions effected without complying with these \ndirections, the issuer shall compensate the customer for the loss in full without \ndemur. \nc. Issuers shall ensure adherence to the provisions of Digital Personal Data \nProtection Act, 2023. \n \nPage 4 of 7 \n \n \n \n10. Cross-border transactions \na. The directions outlined above are not applicable to cross-border digital payment \ntransactions. However, card issuers shall, by October 01, 2026, put in place a \nmechanism to validate non-recurring, cross-border card not present (CNP) \ntransactions, where request for authentication is raised by an overseas \nmerchant or overseas acquirer. To ensure compliance, card issuers shall \nregister their Bank Identification Numbers (BINs) with card networks.  \nb. Further, a risk-based mechanism for handling all cross-border CNP transactions \nshall also be put in place by card issuers by October 01, 2026. \n11.
