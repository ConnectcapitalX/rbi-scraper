Repeal and substitution of Chapter V  \nChapter V - Gold Metal Loans (GML) of the Directions shall be deleted, and \nsubstituted with a new chapter as under: \nChapter V(A) Gold Metal Loans (GML) \nA. Introduction \n51A. The Gold Metal Loan (GML) scheme was launched in 1998 as per Export \nImport Policy 1997-2002 and the Handbook of Procedures of the Exim Policy \nto address the need of working capital finance of the jewellery industry. Over \ntime, the scope of the GML scheme has been broadened to cater to the \nchanging business requirement of the jewellery industry. This Chapter \nprescribes GML related prudential guidelines to address and manage the risks \ninherent in extending GML to borrowers. \nB. Eligible Banks \n52A. Nominated banks importing gold as per the provisions of the Master \nDirection \u2013 Import of Goods and Services, as updated from time to time, may \nextend import-linked GML to entities who either manufacture and / or sell \njewellery in domestic and / or export markets (collectively hereinafter referred \nto as \u2018jewellers\u2019). \nProvided that, jewellers who are not manufacturers themselves, may borrow \nunder GML only for outsourcing their manufacturing of jewellery on job basis to \nany manufacturing firms / artisans / goldsmiths. \n52B. Designated banks implementing the GMS may extend GMS-linked GML \nto following categories of borrowers: \n(i) Jewellers for the purposes as specified in paragraph 52A above, and  \n(ii) MMTC Limited for minting India Gold Coins (IGC). \nC. General Instructions \n53A. A bank shall lay down a lending and risk management policy for GML \nwhich shall, inter alia, prescribe the categories of GML which the bank desires \nto undertake, a limit on the quantity of gold that may be lent per borrower as \nwell as total quantity of such loans that may be outstanding at any point of time. \n3 \n \nThe policy shall also lay down the detailed due-diligence requirements for \ndeciding the eligibility of GML borrowers and their credit requirements. \n53B. GML shall be subject to capital adequacy and other prudential \nrequirements applicable to a lender, similar to any other loan exposure. For all \nprudential and accounting purposes, GML shall be valued daily at an amount \narrived at by converting the gold quantity lent into Indian Rupees by crossing \nLBMA (London Bullion Market Association) Gold AM price fixing for Gold / US \nDollar rate with the Indian Rupee-US Dollar reference rate. \n53C. GML shall not involve any direct or indirect liability of the borrowers \ntowards the lenders\u2019 source of the gold, i.e., the overseas supplier of gold \n(consignor) or the GMS gold deposit account holder. \n53D. A bank shall put in place mechanism to monitor on an ongoing basis the \nexposure level and the end-use of the gold being lent to borrowers under GML \nscheme and ensure that the gold borrowed under GML scheme is neither sold \nnor exported by borrowers in the form of primary gold. \n53E. A bank may extend GML to jewellers who are not their regular customers \nby accepting stand-by letter of credit (SBLC) or bank guarantee (BG) \ndenominated in INR, issued by other scheduled commercial banks that \nmaintain business accounts of the jewellers, notwithstanding any provisions of \nChapter XVI of these Directions. Such arrangements shall be subject to \nindependent credit assessments by both the GML providing bank and the SBLC \n/ BG issuing bank. Further, the SBLC / BG issuing bank shall maintain adequate \nmargin, during the tenor of the loan, consistent with the volatility of the gold \nprices. \n53F. A bank may decide interest rates on GML based on costs of procuring and \nholding gold, and relevant spreads as per their interest rate policies. \nD. Repayment of GML \n54A.

Modifications in Chapter I  \nFollowing definitions shall be inserted after sub-para 4(1)(xv) in Section C of Chapter \n1 of the Directions \u2013 \n(xv)(A) \u2019Gold Metal Loans\u2019 (GML) mean loans extended by eligible banks to \nspecified borrowers in the form of gold metal. \n(a) \u2019GMS-linked GML\u2019 means GML extended by designated banks under \nthe Gold Monetization Scheme, 2015 (GMS), utilising \u2013 (i) the gold \ndeposit accepted by them as Short Term Bank Deposit under the GMS, \nor (ii) gold borrowed from other designated banks under GMS, and \nwhere the repayment can be either in gold or in cash or in a \ncombination of both. \n(b) \u2019Import-linked GML\u2019 means GML extended by nominated banks \nauthorized to import gold, where the source of gold metal lent is gold \nimported by them, and where repayment has to be necessarily in cash. \n2 \n \n4. Repeal and substitution of Chapter V  \nChapter V - Gold Metal Loans (GML) of the Directions shall be deleted, and \nsubstituted with a new chapter as under: \nChapter V(A) Gold Metal Loans (GML) \nA. Introduction \n51A. The Gold Metal Loan (GML) scheme was launched in 1998 as per Export \nImport Policy 1997-2002 and the Handbook of Procedures of the Exim Policy \nto address the need of working capital finance of the jewellery industry. Over \ntime, the scope of the GML scheme has been broadened to cater to the \nchanging business requirement of the jewellery industry. This Chapter \nprescribes GML related prudential guidelines to address and manage the risks \ninherent in extending GML to borrowers. \nB. Eligible Banks \n52A. Nominated banks importing gold as per the provisions of the Master \nDirection \u2013 Import of Goods and Services, as updated from time to time, may \nextend import-linked GML to entities who either manufacture and / or sell \njewellery in domestic and / or export markets (collectively hereinafter referred \nto as \u2018jewellers\u2019). \nProvided that, jewellers who are not manufacturers themselves, may borrow \nunder GML only for outsourcing their manufacturing of jewellery on job basis to \nany manufacturing firms / artisans / goldsmiths. \n52B. Designated banks implementing the GMS may extend GMS-linked GML \nto following categories of borrowers: \n(i) Jewellers for the purposes as specified in paragraph 52A above, and  \n(ii) MMTC Limited for minting India Gold Coins (IGC). \nC. General Instructions \n53A. A bank shall lay down a lending and risk management policy for GML \nwhich shall, inter alia, prescribe the categories of GML which the bank desires \n3 \n \nto undertake, a limit on the quantity of gold that may be lent per borrower as \nwell as total quantity of such loans that may be outstanding at any point of time. \nThe policy shall also lay down the detailed due-diligence requirements for \ndeciding the eligibility of GML borrowers and their credit requirements. \n53B. GML shall be subject to capital adequacy and other prudential \nrequirements applicable to a lender, similar to any other loan exposure. For all \nprudential and accounting purposes, GML shall be valued daily at an amount \narrived at by converting the gold quantity lent into Indian Rupees by crossing \nLBMA (London Bullion Market Association) Gold AM price fixing for Gold / US \nDollar rate with the Indian Rupee-US Dollar reference rate. \n53C. GML shall not involve any direct or indirect liability of the borrowers \ntowards the lenders\u2019 source of the gold, i.e., the overseas supplier of gold \n(consignor) or the GMS gold deposit account holder. \n53D. A bank shall put in place mechanism to monitor on an ongoing basis the \nexposure level and the end-use of the gold being lent to borrowers under GML \nscheme and ensure that the gold borrowed under GML scheme is neither sold \nnor exported by borrowers in the form of primary gold. \n53E. A bank may extend GML to jewellers who are not their regular customers \nby accepting stand-by letter of credit (SBLC) or bank guarantee (BG) \ndenominated in INR, issued by other scheduled commercial banks that \nmaintain business accounts of the jewellers, notwithstanding any provisions of \nChapter XVI of these Directions. Such arrangements shall be subject to \nindependent credit assessments by both the GML providing bank and the SBLC \n/ BG issuing bank. Further, the SBLC / BG issuing bank shall maintain adequate \nmargin, during the tenor of the loan, consistent with the volatility of the gold \nprices. \n53F. A bank may decide interest rates on GML based on costs of procuring and \nholding gold, and relevant spreads as per their interest rate policies. \nD. Repayment of GML \n54A. In case of lending to jewellery exporters, the repayment tenor of GML shall \nbe fixed by a bank subject to the terms and conditions of the extant Foreign Trade \nPolicy (FTP) and the  Handbook of Procedures of the FTP. \n4 \n \n54B. For all GML other than lending to jewellery exporters, a bank may fix a \nrepayment tenor as per its policy, in alignment with working capital cycle of the \njeweller, subject to a ceiling of 270 days. \n54C. Repayment of GML (both principal and interest amounts) shall be made in \nINR, calculated on the basis of prevailing value of the gold lent. \nProvided that, in respect of GMS-linked GML, a bank shall also provide an \noption to the borrower to repay a part or full of the \u2018principal amount\u2019 in \nphysical gold, provided: \n(i) repayment is made using locally sourced IGDS (India Good Delivery \nStandard) / LGDS (LBMA\u2019s Good Delivery Standards) gold; \n(ii) gold is delivered on behalf of the borrower to the bank directly by the \nrefiner or a central agency, acceptable to the bank, without the \nborrower\u2019s involvement; \n(iii) the loan agreement contains details of the option to be exercised by the \nborrower, acceptable standards and manner of delivery of gold for \nrepayment; \n(iv) the borrower is apprised upfront, in a transparent manner, of the \nimplications of exercising the option. \nE. Disclosures \n55A. A bank shall report the GML data to the Reserve Bank on a quarterly basis \nby seventh day of the following month as per the format given in Annex - V. \n5. Insertion of Annex V - Supervisory Return on Gold Metal Loans (GML): \n\u2018Annex V\u2019 as placed in Annexure to this Amendment Directions shall be inserted in \nthe Directions. \n6. The above amendments shall come into force from April 1, 2026.
