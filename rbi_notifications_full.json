A deposit account where a depositor had made nomination in terms of the provisions \nof the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 or where the account was opened with \nsurvivorship clause, the payment of the outstanding balance upon the death of the \ndepositor(s) to the nominee(s)/ survivor(s) shall be considered a valid discharge of a \nbank\u2019s liability, provided: \n(i)  the bank has exercised due care and caution in establishing the identity of \nthe nominee(s)/ survivor(s) and the deceased status of the account holder(s) \nby obtaining appropriate documentary evidence (physical or equivalent e-\ndocument);   \n(ii) there is no order from the competent court in the knowledge of the bank, as \non the date of settlement/ payment, restraining the nominee(s)/ survivor(s) from \nreceiving or the bank from making the payment from the account of the \ndeceased depositor(s); and \n(iii) it has been made clear in writing to the nominee(s)/ survivor(s) that they \nwould be receiving the payment from the bank as a trustee of the legal heirs of \nthe deceased depositor(s), i.e., such payment to them shall not affect the right \nor claim which any person may have against the nominee(s)/ survivor(s) to the \nextent of the payment made to them.  \n4 \n \nIn the case of a joint deposit account with or without survivorship clause, the nominee's \nright arises only after the death of all the depositors. \n9.

Premature termination of term deposits opened jointly, with or without survivorship \nclause, shall require the consent of the surviving depositors and the legal heir(s) of the \ndeceased joint holder, in case of death of one of the depositors.  However, in case of \njoint accounts with survivorship clause, if a specific mandate is furnished by all the \ndepositors jointly to the bank, either at the time of placing the term deposit or anytime \nsubsequently during the tenure of the deposit, then premature withdrawal option shall \nbe allowed to the survivors on the death of any of the depositors, without seeking the \nconcurrence of the legal heir(s) of the deceased joint deposit holder.  \n \nK.

In such cases, a copy of the court order declaring the civil death \nof the account holder shall be obtained in lieu of the death certificate. However, to \navoid inconvenience and undue hardship to the common person where the aggregate \namount payable, including accrued interest, as on the date of the application is less \nthan \u20b91 lakh or such higher amount as may be fixed by the bank, a copy of the First \nInformation Report (FIR) and non-traceable report issued by police authorities shall be \nobtained in lieu of death certificate or an order from a competent court declaring the \ncivil death of the account holder for settling the claim. \n \nIV. Settlement of Claims in Safe Deposit Locker and Articles in Safe Custody \nby Deceased Customer \nL. Claims with Nominee(s)/ Survivor(s) \n16.(a) If a sole locker hirer nominates an individual(s) to receive the contents in the \nlocker in case of her/ his death, a bank shall give access of the locker to such \nnominee(s) with liberty to remove the contents of the locker. \n(b) In case the locker was hired jointly with the instructions to operate it under joint \nsignatures, and the locker hirers nominate any other individual(s), in the event of \n8 \n \ndeath of any of the locker hirers, the bank shall give access of the locker and the \nliberty to remove the contents jointly to the nominee(s) and the survivor(s).  \n(c) In case the locker was hired jointly with survivorship clause and the hirers \ninstructed that the access of the locker should be given to \"either or survivor\", \"anyone \nor survivor\" or \"former or survivor\" or according to any other survivorship clause \npermissible under the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the bank shall \nfollow the mandate in the event of death of one or more of the joint locker hirers. \n17.
