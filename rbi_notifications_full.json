In this regard, it is advised that Government of India has approved the continuation of \nthe Modified Interest Subvention Scheme (MISS) for the financial year 2025-26 with the \nfollowing stipulations: \n(i) \nIn order to provide short term crop loans and short term loans for allied activities \nincluding animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries, bee keeping etc. upto an overall limit \nof \u20b93 lakh to farmers through KCC at concessional interest rate during the year \n2025-26, it has been decided to provide interest subvention to lending institutions \nviz. Public Sector Banks (PSBs) and Private Sector Banks (in respect of loans \ngiven by their rural and semi-urban branches only), Small Finance Banks (SFBs) \n\u092c\u0947\u091f\u0940 \u092c\u091a\u093e\u0913 \n\u092c\u0947\u091f\u0940 \u092a\u095d\u093e\u0913 \n2 \n \nand computerized Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies (PACS) ceded with \nScheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs), on use of their own resources. This \ninterest subvention will be calculated on the loan amount from the date of its \ndisbursement/drawal/renewal up to the date of actual repayment of the loan by \nthe farmer or up to the tenure/ due date/renewal of loans fixed by the \nbanks/PACS, whichever is earlier, subject to a maximum period of one year. The \napplicable lending rate to farmers and the rate of interest subvention for the \nfinancial year 2025-26 will be as follows: \n \nFinancial Year \nLending rate to \nfarmers \nRate of Interest Subvention \nto Lending Institutions \n2025-26 \n7% \n1.50% \n \n(ii) \nAn additional interest subvention of 3% per annum will be provided to such of \nthose farmers repaying in time, i.e., from the date of disbursement/drawl/renewal \nof the loan/s upto the actual date of repayment/tenure/due date or upto the due \ndate fixed by the banks for repayment of such loan/s, whichever is earlier, subject \nto a maximum period of one year from the date of disbursement. This also implies \nthat the farmers repaying promptly as above would get short term crop loans \nand/or short term loans for allied activities including animal husbandry, dairy, \nfisheries, bee keeping etc. @ 4% per annum during the financial year 2025-26. \nThis benefit would not accrue to those farmers who repay their agri loans after \none year of availing such loans. \n(iii) \nInterest subvention and prompt repayment incentive benefits on short term crop \nloans and short term loans for allied activities will be available on an overall limit \nof \u20b93 lakh per annum subject to a maximum sub-limit of \u20b92 lakh per farmer in \nrespect of those farmers involved only in activities related to animal husbandry, \ndairy, fisheries, bee keeping etc. The limit for crop loan component will take \npriority for interest subvention and prompt repayment incentive benefits and the \nresidual amount will be considered towards allied activities including animal \nhusbandry, dairy, fisheries, bee keeping etc. subject to the cap as mentioned \nabove. (Illustrations) \n3 \n \n(iv) \nIn order to discourage distress sale by farmers and to encourage them to store \ntheir produce in warehouses, the benefit of interest subvention under KCC will be \navailable to small and marginal farmers for a further period of upto six months \npost the harvest of the crop against negotiable warehouse receipts on the produce \nstored in warehouses accredited with Warehousing Development Regulatory \nAuthority (WDRA), at the same rate as applicable to the crop loan from the date \nof pledge. \n(v) \nTo provide relief to farmers affected by natural calamities, the applicable rate of \ninterest subvention for that year will be made available to banks for the first year \non the restructured loan amount. Such restructured loans will attract normal rate \nof interest from the second year onwards. \n(vi) \nHowever, to provide relief to farmers affected due to severe natural calamities, \nthe applicable rate of interest subvention for that year will be made available to \nbanks for first three years/entire period (subject to a maximum of five years) on \nthe restructured loan amount. Further, in all such cases, the benefit of prompt \nrepayment incentive @3% per annum shall also be provided to the affected \nfarmers. The grant of such benefit in cases of severe natural calamities shall, \nhowever, be decided by a High Level Committee (HLC) based on the \nrecommendations of the Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) and Sub \nCommittee of National Executive Committee (SC-NEC). \n3. Further, banks are advised to adhere to the following stipulations: \n(i) \nMandatory Aadhaar Authentication: Aadhaar seeding and authentication are \nmandatory for availing benefits under the scheme. All lending institutions must \nensure that e\u00adKYC is completed for every farmer to enable seamless access to \nscheme benefits. \n(ii) \nValidation of Multiple Accounts of beneficiaries: A farmer shall be eligible to \nreceive MISS benefit through multiple KCC subject to an overall limit of \u20b93 lakh per \nfarmer across all such accounts. However, he/she shall be eligible to receive MISS \nbenefits for a specific land parcel through only one Kisan Credit Card (KCC) \naccount. In cases where a farmer maintains multiple KCC accounts linked to the \n4 \n \nsame land parcel, MISS benefit shall be extended only to the account with the \nhighest sanctioned loan amount, subject to the overall limit. \n(iii) \nEncouraging Digital Transactions: Banks may encourage farmers to utilize all \navailable digital banking channels, including RuPay cards, for seamless account \noperations and transactions. \n(iv) \nReporting of Data: Banks are advised to capture and report the requisite granular \ndata of individual farmer beneficiaries under the scheme, including their social \ncategory, on the KRP and ensure that such data is not changed in subsequent \nperiods. This data should be reported accurately to facilitate the settlement of \naudited MISS claims for the year 2025\u201326. \n(v) \nAccurate Crop Reporting on KRP: Field functionaries must exercise due \ndiligence in accurately reporting the data on crops sown on the KRP. Failure to do \nso may lead to validation errors at a later stage. \n(vi) \nSubmission of MISS Claims on KRP: All eligible financial institutions shall strictly \nfollow the operational instructions and ensure timely uploading of MISS claims on \nKRP, duly certified by their Statutory Auditors as true and correct, as per date \nnotified from time to time. \n(vii) \nSubmission of Claims by PACS Ceded with SCBs: The claims in respect of \ncomputerized PACS ceded with SCBs may be uploaded separately by the \nrespective banks, with the certification that interest subvention/prompt repayment \nincentive is being claimed on loans for which no refinance has been availed from \nNABARD, duly certified by the banks\u2019 Statutory Auditors, through KRP module.  \nYours faithfully, \n \n(R.
