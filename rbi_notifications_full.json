It has been decided to transition CTS to continuous clearing and settlement on \nrealisation in two phases. Phase 1 shall be implemented on October 4, 2025 and \nPhase 2 on January 3, 2026. The modalities for the same are given in Annex. \n3. All banks are advised to make their customers adequately aware of the changes in \nthe cheque clearing process.  \n4. Banks are also advised to be in readiness to participate in continuous clearing in \nCTS on the above dates. \n5. This directive is issued under Section 10 (2) read with Section 18 of Payment and \nSettlement Systems Act, 2007 (Act 51 of 2007). \nYours faithfully, \n \n(Saurabh Nath) \nChief General Manager \n \n2 \n \nAnnex \nModalities for Continuous Clearing with Settlement On-realisation in CTS \n1. Single presentation session with continuous delivery:  \na) There shall be a single presentation session from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM.  \nb) Cheques received by the branches shall be scanned and sent to the clearing \nhouse by the banks immediately and continuously during the presentation \nsession.  \nc) The clearing house will in turn release the cheque images to drawee banks on \na continuous basis. \n2. Continuous inward processing and confirmation by banks:  \na) The confirmation session shall start at 10:00 AM and close at 7:00 PM.   \nb) For every cheque presented, the drawee bank shall generate either positive \nconfirmation (for honoured cheques) or negative confirmation (for dishonoured \ncheques).  \nc) Each cheque will contain the \u2018Item Expiry Time\u2019 which indicates the latest time \nby which confirmation for the presented instrument needs to be provided by the \ndrawee bank.   \nd) Processing by drawee banks is to be done continuously throughout the day and \non a real time basis as soon as cheque images are received.  \ne) Information of positive/negative confirmation shall be sent by the drawee banks \nto the clearing house immediately after processing. \n3. Time available for inward processing:  \na) During phase 1 (From October 4 to January 2, 2026), drawee banks shall be \nrequired to confirm (positively / negatively) cheques presented on them latest \nby end of confirmation session (i.e. 7:00 PM) else those will be deemed to have \nbeen approved and included for settlement. Item expiry time for all cheques \nshall be set as 7:00 PM in phase 1.  \n \n3 \n \nb) In Phase 2 (from January 3, 2026), the item expiry time of cheques shall be \nchanged to T+3 clear hours. For example, the cheques received by drawee \nbanks between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM will have to be confirmed positively or \nnegatively by them by 2:00 PM (3 hours from 11:00 AM). Cheques for which \nconfirmation is not provided by the drawee bank in the prescribed 3 hours shall \nbe treated as deemed approved and included for settlement at 2:00 PM.    \n4. Settlement on realisation:  \na) No accounting entries (settlement) will be posted for presentation of cheques.  \nb) Starting from 11:00 AM, settlement will be arrived every hour till the end of \nconfirmation session, based on the positive confirmations received from \ndrawee banks and cheques considered deemed approved.  \nc) No accounting entries shall be passed for cheques with negative confirmation.  \n5. Releasing payment to customers:  \na) On completion of settlement, clearing house shall release the information of \npositive and negative confirmations to the presenting bank.  \nb) The presenting bank shall process the same and release the payment to the \ncustomers immediately, but not later than 1 hour from successful settlement, \nsubject to usual safeguards. \n \n \n",

Introduction \n1. Non-fund based (NFB) facilities like guarantees, letters of credit, co-acceptances \netc. facilitate effective credit intermediation and smooth business transactions. \nIn order to harmonize and consolidate guidelines covering these facilities across \nthe entities regulated by the Reserve Bank and to broaden the funding sources \nfor infrastructure financing, the Reserve Bank had issued draft guidelines on \nNFB facilities for public comments on April 9, 2025. The comments received \nthereon have been analysed and suitably incorporated in these Directions. \n2. In exercise of the powers conferred under sections 21 and 35A read with section \n56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, sections 45JA, 45L and 45M of the \nReserve Bank of India Act, 1934, and sections 30A, 32 and 33 of the National \nHousing Bank Act, 1987, the Reserve Bank of India, being satisfied that it is \nnecessary and expedient in the public interest and in the interest of banking \npolicy to do so, hereby, issues the Reserve Bank of India (Non-Fund Based \nCredit Facilities) Directions, 2025 (hereinafter referred to as \u2018Directions\u2019). \nB. Applicability \n3. These Directions shall apply to the following entities, hereinafter referred to as \nRegulated Entity (RE) and collectively as Regulated Entities (REs), as the \ncontext may require, for all their Non-Fund Based (NFB) exposures such as \nguarantee, letter of credit, co-acceptance etc., unless otherwise permitted under \nthese Directions or any regulatory guidelines/ directions issued by the Reserve \nBank. \na. Commercial Banks (including Regional Rural Banks and Local Area Banks); \nb. Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs)/ State Co-operative Banks \n(StCBs)/ Central Co-operative Banks (CCBs); \nc. All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs); \nd. Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) including Housing Finance \nCompanies (HFCs) in Middle Layer and above, only for the issuance of \nPage 3 of 20 \n \nPartial Credit Enhancement, as permitted under Chapter IV of these \nDirections.   \nProvided that these Directions shall not apply to the derivative exposures of \na RE, other than the general conditions as laid down under Chapter II of these \nDirections.  \n4. These Directions shall come into force from April 1, 2026, or from any earlier \ndate as decided by a RE as per its internal policy (\u201ceffective date\u201d). Extension of \nany new NFB facility and renewal of an existing NFB facility after the effective \ndate, shall be governed in terms of these Directions. All existing NFB facilities \nextended/ renewed till the effective date shall be governed by the existing \ninstructions as applicable to the respective REs. \nC. Definitions \n5. For the purpose of these Directions, the following definitions shall apply: \na. \u201cBeneficiary\u201d means the party in whose favour the NFB facility is issued by a \nRE.  \nb. \u201cCo-acceptance of bills\u201d means an undertaking to make payment to the \ndrawer of the bill (seller/ exporter) on due date if the buyer/ importer fails to \nmake the payment on that date. \nc. \u201cGuarantee\u201d means a contract to perform the promise, or discharge the \nliability, of a third person in the contingent case of his non-performance or \ndefault, in terms of The Indian Contract Act, 1872. \nd. \u201cGuarantor\u201d refers to the party which issues the guarantee. \ne. \u201cObligor\u201d refers to a party against whose obligations, financial or otherwise, \na NFB facility has been issued. In the case of guarantees, the obligor may \nalso be termed as \u2018principal debtor\u2019, as defined under the Indian Contract \nAct, 1872. \nf. \u201cSecured portion of an NFB facility\u201d is the portion of the facility covered by \nrealisable value of tangible security/ collateral estimated on a realistic basis. \nPage 4 of 20 \n \nChapter II \nGeneral Conditions  \n6. The credit policy of a RE shall incorporate suitable provisions for issue of NFB \nfacilities, inter alia, covering aspects relating to type of NFB facilities, limits \ngranted, credit appraisal, security requirement, fraud prevention, overall \nmonitoring mechanism including post-sanction monitoring, delegation matrix, \naudit and internal controls, compliance to uniform standards issued by standard \nsetting bodies and other safeguards. \n7. A RE shall issue a NFB facility only on behalf of a customer having funded credit \nfacility from the RE. \nProvided that this clause shall not be applicable in respect of: \na. Derivative contracts entered into by RE with counterparty.  \nb. Partial Credit enhancement facility, as permitted under clause 23 of these \nDirections. \nc. NFB facilities issued based on the counter guarantee of another RE, as \npermitted under clause 15 of these Directions. \nd. NFB facilities on behalf of an obligor who has not availed any fund based \nfacility from any RE in India. \ne. NFB facilities extended by a RE against No Objection Certificate issued by \nthe RE/ REs which has/ have provided fund based facility to the obligor. \nf. NFB facilities which are fully secured by eligible financial collateral. \nExplanation: The eligible financial collateral specified herein for all REs shall \nbe as defined under paragraph 7.3.5 of Master Circular \u2013 Basel III Capital \nRegulations dated April 01, 2025 as updated from time to time \n8.  A RE shall not issue a NFB facility to any entity assuring redemption/ repayment \nof funds raised by any entity via deposits, issuance of bonds, or in any other \nform, unless specifically permitted under any regulatory guidelines/ directions \nissued by the Reserve Bank. \n9. Once a NFB facility devolves and is converted into a fund based facility, then the \nprudential norms shall be as applicable to fund based facilities.   \nPage 5 of 20 \n \nChapter \u2013 III \nConditions applicable to Guarantees and Co-acceptances \nA. Guarantees \n10. In general, a guarantee (or a counter-guarantee) issued by a RE (guarantor) \nshall be irrevocable (i.e., there shall be no clause in the contract that would allow \nthe guarantor to unilaterally cancel the same), unconditional (i.e. there shall be \nno clause in the contract that could prevent the RE from being obliged to pay out \nin a timely manner in the event that the original counterparty fails to meet its \nobligation), incontrovertible and shall contain a clear mechanism for honouring \nthe same without demur as and when invoked. \n11. A RE shall put in place suitable internal aggregate/ individual ceilings for \nissuance of guarantees in general and unsecured guarantees in particular.  \nProvided that the total volume of guaranteed obligations of UCBs, RRBs, \nLABs, StCBs and CCBs outstanding at any time shall not exceed 5% of their \ntotal assets as per the previous financial year\u2019s balance sheet. Further, \nunsecured guarantees of these REs shall be restricted to 1.25% of total assets. \nAny such RE in breach of the above stipulation as on the date of issue of these \nDirections shall meet the above threshold by April 01, 2027.  \n12. The provisions of the internal policy relating to guarantees shall, inter alia, \naddress aspects related to invocation and settlement mechanism, claim period, \ntenor, fee/ commission/ applicable charges, timelines for release of security, \nrenewal, fraud prevention measures etc.  \nUsage of electronic-Guarantee  \n13. Wherever a RE issues an electronic Guarantee, it shall frame a standard \noperating procedure (SOP) aimed at minimization of manual intervention; \nmeeting system integration requirements; ensuring technological compatibility \nbetween the RE\u2019s interface and the electronic Guarantee platforms, audit and \ninternal controls etc. The SOP shall, inter alia, consider the aspects mentioned \nin Annex 1. \n \n \nPage 6 of 20 \n \nGuarantee favouring another RE \n14. A RE shall, in general, not provide a guarantee favouring another RE to enable \nit to provide any fund based credit facility to an obligor.  \nProvided that this clause shall not be applicable in case of credit facilities \nextended against guarantees pertaining to trade related transactions. \n15. However, a RE may provide a guarantee favouring another RE for a NFB facility \nextended by the latter. Such guarantee issued by a RE shall be treated as an \nexposure on the obligor on whose behalf the guarantee has been issued by it, \nfor all purposes including for the calculation of capital adequacy. The exposure \nof the RE extending credit facility against a guarantee shall be treated as a claim/ \nexposure on the RE which is providing the counter guarantee. \nTimely Payment of Invoked Guarantee \n16. A RE shall honour the guarantee issued by it as and when invoked in accordance \nwith the terms and conditions of the guarantee deed unless there is court order \nrestraining the same.  \nB. Co-acceptances  \n17. Only genuine trade bills shall be co-accepted, and it shall be ensured that the \ngoods covered by bills co-accepted are actually received in the stock accounts \nof the borrowers.  \n18. Proper records of the bills co-accepted for each customer shall be maintained, \nso that the commitments for each customer and the total commitments at a \nbranch can be readily ascertained, and these shall be part of internal audit.  \n19. A RE shall not co-accept bills drawn by another RE or where the buyer/ seller \nhas received funding for the underlying trade transaction from any RE.  \nC. Requirements for Other Specific Guarantees \nGuarantee and related business involving overseas current or capital account \ntransaction  \n20. REs permitted as Authorized Dealer (AD) may extend NFB facilities as permitted \nunder the extant regulations/ Directions issued under Foreign Exchange \nManagement Act, 1999, for bonafide current or capital account transaction, \nPage 7 of 20 \n \nincluding guarantees in respect of debt or other liability incurred by an exporter \non account of exports from India. \n21. AD banks are also permitted to issue guarantee to or on behalf of a foreign entity, \nor any of its step-down subsidiary in which an Indian entity has acquired control \nthrough the foreign entity, which is backed by a counter-guarantee or collateral \nby the Indian entity or its group company. \nProvided that such guarantees shall not be issued by banks, including \noverseas branches/ subsidiaries of Indian banks, for the purpose of raising \nloans/ advances of any kind by the foreign entity except in connection with the \nordinary course of business overseas. Further while extending such guarantees, \nbanks shall ensure effective monitoring of the end use of such facilities and its \nconformity with the business needs of such entities. \nGuarantees on behalf of Stock/ Commodity Brokers \n22. Only Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) may issue guarantees on behalf of \nstock/ commodity brokers in favour of stock/ commodity exchanges in lieu of \nsecurity deposit to the extent it is acceptable in the form of bank guarantee as \nlaid down by exchanges. SCBs may also issue guarantees in lieu of margin \nrequirements as per exchange regulations read along with other instructions \nissued by Reserve Bank in this regard from time to time. \nChapter - IV \nPartial Credit Enhancement \n23. SCBs (excluding RRBs), AIFIs, NBFCs including HFCs in Middle Layer and \nabove (together termed as \u201cREs\u201d for the purpose of Chapter IV) may provide \nPartial Credit Enhancement (PCE) to bonds issued by corporates/ special \npurpose vehicles (SPVs) for funding all types of projects and to bonds issued by \nNon-deposit taking NBFCs with asset size of \u20b91,000 crore and above registered \nwith RBI (including HFCs). PCE may also be provided to bonds issued by \nMunicipal Corporations subject to adherence to, inter alia, paragraph 2.3.7.3 (iii) \nof Master Circular - Loans and Advances \u2013 Statutory and Other Restrictions \ndated July 01, 2015 as amended from time to time.  \nPage 8 of 20 \n \n24. The objective behind allowing REs to extend PCE is to enhance the credit rating \nof the bonds issued so as to enable corporates to access the funds from the \nbond market on better terms. The guidelines in this regard are as below:  \nA. Salient features of the PCE facility \n25. The credit policy of the RE shall incorporate suitable provisions for issue of PCE, \ncovering issues such as quantum of PCE, underwriting standards, assessment \nof risk, pricing, setting limits, etc. \n26. PCE shall be a subordinated facility provided in the form of an irrevocable \ncontingent line of credit which will be drawn in case of shortfall in cash flows for \nservicing the bonds and thereby may improve the credit rating of the bond issue. \nThe contingent facility may, at the discretion of the PCE providing RE, be made \navailable as a revolving facility. \n27. A clear agreement documenting all aspects of this arrangement shall be signed \nbetween the promoter (bond issuer), the PCE providing RE, the bondholders \n(through the Trustee) and all other lenders to the project. The agreement to this \neffect shall be in the nature of a legally binding contract. The documentation for \nthe facility shall clearly define the circumstances under which the facility would \nbe drawn upon. \n28. The PCE exposure limit by a single RE shall be 50 per cent of the bond issue \nsize. The aggregate exposure limit of all REs towards the PCE for a given bond \nissue has also been capped at 50 per cent of the bond issue size. \n29. The PCE facility shall be provided at the time of the bond issue and shall be \nirrevocable. PCE cannot be provided by way of guarantee.  \n30. As the purpose of PCE by REs is to enable wide investor participation in the \ncorporate bond market, REs shall not invest in corporate bonds which are credit \nenhanced by other REs. They may, however, provide other need based credit \nfacilities (funded and/ or non-funded) to the corporate/ SPV. \n31. REs may offer PCE only in respect of bonds whose pre-enhanced rating are not \nlower than \u201cBBB\u201d minus as issued by accredited External Credit Assessment \nInstitutions (ECAI). \nPage 9 of 20 \n \n32. To be eligible for PCE, corporate bonds shall be rated by a minimum of two ECAI \nat all times. \n33. The rating reports, both initial and subsequent, shall disclose both standalone \ncredit rating (i.e., rating without taking into account the effect of PCE) as well as \nthe enhanced credit rating (taking into account the effect of PCE). \n34. So long as the exposure of a RE to a project loan is classified as standard and \nthe borrower is not in any financial distress (Refer to Annex 1 of Prudential \nFramework for Resolution of Stressed Assets dated June 7, 2019 for indicative \nlist of signs of financial difficulty), providing a commercially priced PCE to \nenhance the rating of a bond issue, whose proceeds replace, in whole or in part, \nthe RE\u2019s project loan, would not amount to restructuring. \n35. The PCE shall be available only for servicing the bond and not for any other \npurpose (such as funding acquisition of additional assets by the corporate, \nmeeting part of the project cost or meeting recurring expenses of the corporate \nor servicing other lenders/ creditors to the project etc.), irrespective of the \nseniority of claims of other creditors in relation to the bond holders.  \n36. In case the PCE facility is partly drawn and interest accrues on the same, the \nunpaid accrued interest shall be excluded from the calculation of the remaining \namount available for drawing. \nB. Balance Sheet treatment, capital requirements, exposure and asset \nclassification norms for exposures arising on account of providing PCE \n37. PCE facilities to the extent drawn shall be treated as an on-balance sheet \nadvance in the balance sheet. Undrawn facilities would be an off-balance sheet \nitem and reported under \u2018Contingent Liability \u2013 Others\u2019.  \n38. The capital required to be maintained by the RE providing PCE for a given bond \nissue shall be based on the PCE amount and the applicable risk weight for the \nRE corresponding to the pre- enhanced rating of the bond.  \nTo illustrate, in the case of a SCB, assume that the total bond size is \u20b9100 \nand pre-enhanced rating of the bond is BBB. In this scenario, the applicable risk \nweight at the pre-enhanced rating of BBB is 100%.  \nPage 10 of 20 \n \nThe capital requirement (assuming CRAR of 9%) for varying amount of PCE, \nwould, therefore be: \nPCE Amount (\u20b9) \nCapital Requirement for PCE provider (\u20b9) \n20 \n1.8 (20*100%*9%) \n30 \n2.7 (30*100%*9%) \n40 \n3.6 (40*100%*9%) \n50 \n4.5 (50*100%*9%) \n \n39. For the purpose of capital computation in the books of PCE provider, lower of \nthe two pre-enhanced credit ratings shall be reckoned. \n40. It is possible that the credit rating of the bond changes during the lifetime of the \nbond, necessitating a change in the capital requirement. Therefore, the rating of \nthe bond shall be monitored regularly, and capital requirement adjusted in the \nfollowing manner: \na. In case of change in the pre-enhanced rating of the bond, the capital required \nshall be recalculated based on the risk weight applicable to revised pre-\nenhanced rating, subject to a floor, i.e., the capital requirement on the PCE \nat the time of issuance of the PCE enhanced bonds. \nb. As long as the bond outstanding amount exceeds the aggregate PCE (drawn \nand contingent non-funded) offered, the capital held shall not be less than \nthe amount required to be held at the time of issuance of the PCE enhanced \nbond. However, once the bond outstanding has amortised below the \naggregate PCE amount, the capital can be computed taking into account the \noutstanding bond amount. \nc. In situations where the pre-enhanced rating of the bond slips below \ninvestment grade (BBB minus), full capital to the extent of PCE provided shall \nbe maintained by all REs, including NBFCs and HFCs. \n41. In all circumstances, the capital computed for PCE as mentioned above and \nrequired to be maintained by the PCE provider, shall be capped by the total \namount of PCE provided. \n42. In a waterfall mechanism, Credit Enhancement (CE) gets drawn only in a \ncontingent situation of cash flow shortfall for servicing a debt/ bond etc., and not \nPage 11 of 20 \n \nin the normal course of business. Hence, such an event is indicative of financial \ndistress of the project. Keeping this aspect in view, a drawn tranche of the \ncontingent PCE facility shall be required to be repaid within 30 days from the \ndate of its drawal (due date). The facility shall be treated as NPA if it remains \noutstanding for 90 days or more from the due date and provided for as per the \nusual asset classification and provisioning norms. In that event, the RE\u2019s other \nfacilities to the borrower shall also be classified as NPA as per extant guidelines. \n43. The PCE providing RE shall observe the following exposure limits:  \na. PCE exposure by a RE to a single counterparty or group of counterparties \nshall be within the overall regulatory exposure limits applicable to each \ncategory of RE. \nb. The aggregate PCE exposure of a RE shall not exceed 20 per cent of its Tier \n1 capital. \nC. Additional conditions for providing PCE to bonds of NBFCs and HFCs \n44. The tenor of the bond issued by NBFCs/ HFCs for which PCE is provided shall \nnot be less than three years. \n45. The proceeds from the bonds backed by PCE from REs shall only be utilized for \nrefinancing the existing debt of the NBFCs/ HFCs. REs shall introduce \nappropriate mechanisms to monitor and ensure that the end-use condition is \nmet. \n46. The exposure of a RE by way of PCEs to bonds issued by each such NBFC/ \nHFC shall be restricted to one percent of capital funds of the RE within the extant \nsingle/ group borrower exposure limits. \nD. Other Aspects of PCE \n47. The effect of the PCE on the bond rating shall be disclosed in the bond offer \ndocument i.e., the rating of the bond without and with the PCE shall be disclosed. \n48. REs shall ensure that the project assets, created out of the bond issue for which \nPCE has been provided by them, and the cash flows from the project are ring \nfenced through an escrow account mechanism administered under a bond \ntrustee arrangement. The manner in which security interest in the project assets \nwould be shared by the lenders to the project, bond holders and REs providing \nPage 12 of 20 \n \nthe PCE and the manner in which the project cash flows would be shared for \nservicing loans, if any, and the bonds and PCE, shall be decided and agreed \nupon before the issue of bonds and shall be properly documented. \n49. The project shall have a robust and viable financial structure even before the \ncredit enhancement is taken into account. Nevertheless, while providing PCE, \nREs shall exercise necessary due diligence and credit appraisal, including \nmaking their own internal credit analysis/ rating. \n50. REs shall honour the full PCE commitment irrespective of the asset classification \nof the concerned borrower\u2019s credit facilities.  \n51. All extant regulatory prescriptions for credit and investment exposures by REs, \nunless specified otherwise in this Direction, shall continue to apply. \nChapter - V \nExclusions and Other Aspects \n52. These Directions have been issued without prejudice to Directions under \nForeign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999; Foreign Exchange \nManagement (Guarantees) Regulations, 2000, notified vide Notification No. \nFEMA 8/2000-RB dated May 03, 2000; as amended from time to time. \n53.

While there is no generic regulatory framework for such lending \narrangements, co-lending involving banks and NBFCs has gained traction in the wake \nof a specific regulatory framework being prescribed for the purpose of priority sector \nlending in terms of circular FIDD.CO.Plan.BC.No.8/04.09.01/2020-21 dated \nNovember 5, 2020.  \nIn view of this and to broaden the scope of co-lending, comprehensive revised \nDirections on co-lending arrangements (CLA) are now being issued with the objective \nof providing specific regulatory clarity on the permissibility of such arrangements, while \naddressing some of the prudential as well as conduct related aspects. These \nDirections are issued in exercise of the powers conferred by the Sections 21 and 35A \nof the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, read with Section 56 of the Act ibid; Chapter IIIB \nof the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934; and Sections 30A, 32 and 33 of the National \nHousing Bank Act, 1987. \nShort title and commencement \n1. These Directions shall be called Reserve Bank of India (Co-Lending \nArrangements) Directions, 2025. \n2. These Directions shall come into force from January 1, 2026, or from any earlier \ndate as decided by a RE as per its internal policy (\u201ceffective date\u201d). Any new \nCLA entered into after the effective date shall be in compliance with these \nDirections. \n3. Existing CLAs (i.e., the lending arrangements executed before the date of \nissuance of these Directions) and new CLAs entered into prior to the effective \ndate shall be in compliance with the extant regulations. \nApplicability \n \n4. These Directions shall be applicable to CLAs entered into by the following REs: \na) Commercial Banks (excluding Small Finance Banks, Local Area Banks and \nRegional Rural Banks); \nb) All-India Financial Institutions; and, \nPage 3 of 8 \n \nc) Non-Banking \nFinancial \nCompanies \n(including \nHousing \nFinance \nCompanies). \n5. Digital lending arrangements shall continue to be governed by the Reserve \nBank of India (Digital Lending) Directions, 2025 (MD-DLD) as amended from \ntime to time.  \nProvided that, any digital lending arrangement involving co-lending by \nthe REs shall, without derogation to the MD-DLD, be guided by the \nprovisions of these Directions.  \n \n6. These Directions shall not apply to loans sanctioned under multiple banking, \nconsortium lending, or syndication.  \n7. Save as otherwise permitted in terms of these Directions, no RE shall enter into \nany CLA which is not compliant with these Directions. \nDefinitions \n \n8. For the purpose of these Directions, CLA refers to an arrangement, formalised \nthrough an ex-ante agreement, between a RE which is originating the loans \n(\u2018originating RE\u2019) and another RE which is co-lending (\u2018partner RE\u2019), to jointly \nfund a portfolio of loans, comprising of either secured or unsecured loans, in a \npre-agreed proportion, involving revenue and risk sharing.  \n \n \n9. All other expressions, unless defined herein, shall have the same meaning as \nhave been assigned to them under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 or the \nReserve Bank of India Act, 1934 or any statutory modification or re-enactment \nthereto or any other relevant regulation or as used in commercial parlance, as \nthe case may be. \nGeneral Guidelines  \n10. Each RE under a CLA shall be required to retain a minimum 10 per cent share \nof the individual loans in its books.  \n11. The credit policy of a RE shall suitably incorporate provisions relating to CLAs, \nincluding the internal limit for the proportion of their lending portfolio under \nCLAs; target borrower segments; due diligence of the partner entities; customer \nservice and grievance redressal mechanism. \nPage 4 of 8 \n \n12. The agreement to be entered between the CLA partners shall include detailed \nterms and conditions of the arrangement; the criteria for selection of borrowers; \nspecific product lines and areas of operation; fees payable for lending \nservices1, if any; provisions related to segregation of responsibilities; time-\nframe for exchanging critical information; customer interface and customer \nprotection issues and grievance redressal mechanism.  \n13. The loan agreement signed with the borrower shall make an upfront disclosure \nregarding the segregation of the roles and responsibilities (such as sourcing, \nand servicing) of concerned REs, including clear identification of the entity \nbeing the single point of interface with the customer. Any subsequent change \nin customer interface shall only be done after prior intimation to the borrower. \nThe loan-agreement shall also appropriately disclose suitable provisions \nrelated to customer protection, and grievance redressal mechanism. \n14. All required details of CLA shall be disclosed appropriately to the concerned \nborrower as laid down under RBI Circular on \u2018Key Facts Statement (KFS) for \nLoans & Advances\u2019 dated April 15, 2024 as amended from time to time.  \n15. REs engaging in the CLA for loans eligible to be classified under priority sector \nlending in terms of Master Directions - Reserve Bank of India (Priority Sector \nLending \u2013 Targets and Classification) Directions, 2025 (as amended from time \nto time), can claim priority sector status in respect of their share of credit under \nCLA.  \n16. NBFCs shall adhere to the applicable accounting standards, while booking of \nunrealised profit under CLAs, if applicable. However, such profits, shall be \ndeducted from CET 1 capital or net owned funds for meeting regulatory capital \nadequacy requirement till the maturity of such loans. \nInterest Rate and Other Fees/ Charges  \n17. The interest rate and any other fees / charges on the underlying loans charged \nto the borrower shall be based on the contractual agreement, subject to the \nregulatory norms applicable to the REs. Specifically, the final interest rate \n                                                          \n1 Lending service shall refer to the set of activities related to lending such as customer acquisition, \nunderwriting, pricing, servicing, monitoring, and recovery of specific loan or loan portfolio, etc. \nperformed by the REs or their agents (in conformity with extant outsourcing guidelines issued by the \nReserve Bank). \nPage 5 of 8 \n \ncharged to the borrower shall be the blended interest rate which is calculated \nas an average rate of interest derived from the interest rates charged by \nrespective REs, as per their internal lending policies and risk profile of the same \nor similar borrower, weighted by the proportionate funding share of concerned \nREs under CLA.  \n18. Any change in rates by respective REs under CLA will be made as per their \ncredit policy and extant regulatory norms, and the same shall be reflected in the \nupdated blended rate and communicated to the borrower.  \n19.  Any fees / charges payable by the borrower in addition to the blended interest \nrate shall be incorporated in computation of annual percentage rate (APR) and \ndisclosed appropriately in the KFS as prescribed in the paragraph 14 of these \nDirections.  \n20. As part of the credit policy, the RE shall lay down the objective criteria for fees/ \ncharges payable for lending services, depending upon relevant factors such as \nthe nature of service provided, quantum of loan, etc. Such fees/ charges shall \nnot involve, directly or indirectly, any element of credit enhancement2/ default \nloss guarantee3 unless permitted otherwise. \nOperational Arrangements  \n21. The CLA shall entail an irrevocable commitment on the part of partner RE to \ntake into its books, on back to back basis, its share of the individual loans as \noriginated by the originating RE. \n22. The CLA shall ensure that the respective shares of the REs are reflected in the \nbooks of both REs without delay after disbursement by the originating RE to the \nborrower, in any case not later than 15 calendar days from the date of \ndisbursement.   \n                                                          \n2 Credit enhancement means a contractual arrangement in which an entity provides some degree of \nadded protection to other parties to a transaction to mitigate the credit risk of their acquired exposures; \n \n3 Default loss guarantee is a contractual arrangement, called by whatever name, between the \noriginating RE and partner RE, under which the former guarantees to compensate the latter, for loss \ndue to default up to a certain percentage of the loan portfolio of the RE, specified upfront. Any other \nimplicit guarantee of similar nature linked to the performance of the loan portfolio of the RE and specified \nupfront, shall also be covered under the definition of DLG \nPage 6 of 8 \n \n23. Originating RE shall also ensure that it transfers the loan under CLA only to the \npartner RE, as per the ex-ante agreement and as specified in the KFS at the \ntime of sanction of loan.  \n24. If the originating RE is unable to transfer the share of the exposure to the \npartner RE under CLA within 15 calendar days for any reason, then the loan/s \nshall remain on the books of the originating RE and can be transferred to other \neligible lenders only under the provisions of Master Directions \u2013 Transfer of \nLoan Exposure, 2021 (MD-TLE). \n25. Each RE shall maintain a borrower\u2019s account individually for its respective \nshare.  \n26. All transactions (disbursements / repayments) between the REs, as well as with \nthe borrower, shall be routed through an escrow account maintained with a \nbank (which could also be one of the REs involved in CLA). The agreement \nshall clearly specify the manner of appropriation between the originating and \npartner REs.  \n27. The loans under the CLA shall be included in the scope of internal/ statutory \naudit in each RE to ensure adherence to their respective internal guidelines, \nterms of the agreement and applicable regulatory requirements. \n28. REs shall implement a business continuity plan to ensure uninterrupted service \nto their borrowers till repayment of the loans, in the event of termination of CLA \nbetween the REs. \n29.  A RE involved under CLA shall comply with the prescribed norms under the \nMaster Direction - Know Your Customer (KYC) Direction, 2016 as amended \nfrom time to time. Partner RE may rely upon the originating RE for \u201cCustomer \nIdentification Process\u201d as per the provisions of the said Master Directions on \nKYC.  \n30.  REs shall be guided by the fair practice code and grievance redressal \nmechanism as applicable to them. \nReporting to credit information companies (CICs) \n31. Each RE shall adhere to the extant requirements of reporting to CICs for their \nshare of the loan account, as per the provisions of the Credit Information \nCompanies (Regulation) Act, 2005 and the Rules and Regulations issued by \nRBI therein, from time to time. \nPage 7 of 8 \n \nDefault Loss Guarantee  \n32. Originating RE may provide default loss guarantee up to five per cent of loans \noutstanding in respect of loans under CLA. Provision of such default loss \nguarantee shall be governed mutatis mutandis in terms of the MD-DLD as \namended from time to time.  \nAsset Classification Norms \n33. REs shall apply a borrower-level asset classification for their respective \nexposures to a borrower under CLA, implying that if either of the REs classifies \nits exposure to a borrower under CLA as SMA / NPA on account of default in \nthe CLA exposure, the same classification shall be applicable to the exposure \nof the other RE to the borrower under CLA. REs shall put in place a robust \nmechanism for sharing relevant information in this regard on a near-real time \nbasis, and in any case latest by end of the next working day. \nTransfer of Loan Exposures  \n34. Any subsequent transfer of loan exposures originated under CLA to third \nparties, or any inter-se transfer of such loan exposures between REs, shall be \nstrictly in compliance with the provisions of MD-TLE. Such transfers to a third \nparty, however, can be done only with the mutual consent of both the originating \nand partner REs. \nDisclosures \n35. In addition to the applicable disclosure requirements under extant regulations, \nREs shall also prominently disclose on their website, a list of all active CLA \npartners.  \n \n36.
