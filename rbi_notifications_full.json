It has been decided to transition CTS to continuous clearing and settlement on \nrealisation in two phases. Phase 1 shall be implemented on October 4, 2025 and \nPhase 2 on January 3, 2026. The modalities for the same are given in Annex. \n3. All banks are advised to make their customers adequately aware of the changes in \nthe cheque clearing process.  \n4. Banks are also advised to be in readiness to participate in continuous clearing in \nCTS on the above dates. \n5. This directive is issued under Section 10 (2) read with Section 18 of Payment and \nSettlement Systems Act, 2007 (Act 51 of 2007). \nYours faithfully, \n \n(Saurabh Nath) \nChief General Manager \n \n2 \n \nAnnex \nModalities for Continuous Clearing with Settlement On-realisation in CTS \n1. Single presentation session with continuous delivery:  \na) There shall be a single presentation session from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM.  \nb) Cheques received by the branches shall be scanned and sent to the clearing \nhouse by the banks immediately and continuously during the presentation \nsession.  \nc) The clearing house will in turn release the cheque images to drawee banks on \na continuous basis. \n2. Continuous inward processing and confirmation by banks:  \na) The confirmation session shall start at 10:00 AM and close at 7:00 PM.   \nb) For every cheque presented, the drawee bank shall generate either positive \nconfirmation (for honoured cheques) or negative confirmation (for dishonoured \ncheques).  \nc) Each cheque will contain the \u2018Item Expiry Time\u2019 which indicates the latest time \nby which confirmation for the presented instrument needs to be provided by the \ndrawee bank.   \nd) Processing by drawee banks is to be done continuously throughout the day and \non a real time basis as soon as cheque images are received.  \ne) Information of positive/negative confirmation shall be sent by the drawee banks \nto the clearing house immediately after processing. \n3. Time available for inward processing:  \na) During phase 1 (From October 4 to January 2, 2026), drawee banks shall be \nrequired to confirm (positively / negatively) cheques presented on them latest \nby end of confirmation session (i.e. 7:00 PM) else those will be deemed to have \nbeen approved and included for settlement. Item expiry time for all cheques \nshall be set as 7:00 PM in phase 1.  \n \n3 \n \nb) In Phase 2 (from January 3, 2026), the item expiry time of cheques shall be \nchanged to T+3 clear hours. For example, the cheques received by drawee \nbanks between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM will have to be confirmed positively or \nnegatively by them by 2:00 PM (3 hours from 11:00 AM). Cheques for which \nconfirmation is not provided by the drawee bank in the prescribed 3 hours shall \nbe treated as deemed approved and included for settlement at 2:00 PM.    \n4. Settlement on realisation:  \na) No accounting entries (settlement) will be posted for presentation of cheques.  \nb) Starting from 11:00 AM, settlement will be arrived every hour till the end of \nconfirmation session, based on the positive confirmations received from \ndrawee banks and cheques considered deemed approved.  \nc) No accounting entries shall be passed for cheques with negative confirmation.  \n5. Releasing payment to customers:  \na) On completion of settlement, clearing house shall release the information of \npositive and negative confirmations to the presenting bank.  \nb) The presenting bank shall process the same and release the payment to the \ncustomers immediately, but not later than 1 hour from successful settlement, \nsubject to usual safeguards. \n \n \n",

While there is no generic regulatory framework for such lending \narrangements, co-lending involving banks and NBFCs has gained traction in the wake \nof a specific regulatory framework being prescribed for the purpose of priority sector \nlending in terms of circular FIDD.CO.Plan.BC.No.8/04.09.01/2020-21 dated \nNovember 5, 2020.  \nIn view of this and to broaden the scope of co-lending, comprehensive revised \nDirections on co-lending arrangements (CLA) are now being issued with the objective \nof providing specific regulatory clarity on the permissibility of such arrangements, while \naddressing some of the prudential as well as conduct related aspects. These \nDirections are issued in exercise of the powers conferred by the Sections 21 and 35A \nof the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, read with Section 56 of the Act ibid; Chapter IIIB \nof the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934; and Sections 30A, 32 and 33 of the National \nHousing Bank Act, 1987. \nShort title and commencement \n1. These Directions shall be called Reserve Bank of India (Co-Lending \nArrangements) Directions, 2025. \n2. These Directions shall come into force from January 1, 2026, or from any earlier \ndate as decided by a RE as per its internal policy (\u201ceffective date\u201d). Any new \nCLA entered into after the effective date shall be in compliance with these \nDirections. \n3. Existing CLAs (i.e., the lending arrangements executed before the date of \nissuance of these Directions) and new CLAs entered into prior to the effective \ndate shall be in compliance with the extant regulations. \nApplicability \n \n4. These Directions shall be applicable to CLAs entered into by the following REs: \na) Commercial Banks (excluding Small Finance Banks, Local Area Banks and \nRegional Rural Banks); \nb) All-India Financial Institutions; and, \nPage 3 of 8 \n \nc) Non-Banking \nFinancial \nCompanies \n(including \nHousing \nFinance \nCompanies). \n5. Digital lending arrangements shall continue to be governed by the Reserve \nBank of India (Digital Lending) Directions, 2025 (MD-DLD) as amended from \ntime to time.  \nProvided that, any digital lending arrangement involving co-lending by \nthe REs shall, without derogation to the MD-DLD, be guided by the \nprovisions of these Directions.  \n \n6. These Directions shall not apply to loans sanctioned under multiple banking, \nconsortium lending, or syndication.  \n7. Save as otherwise permitted in terms of these Directions, no RE shall enter into \nany CLA which is not compliant with these Directions. \nDefinitions \n \n8. For the purpose of these Directions, CLA refers to an arrangement, formalised \nthrough an ex-ante agreement, between a RE which is originating the loans \n(\u2018originating RE\u2019) and another RE which is co-lending (\u2018partner RE\u2019), to jointly \nfund a portfolio of loans, comprising of either secured or unsecured loans, in a \npre-agreed proportion, involving revenue and risk sharing.  \n \n \n9. All other expressions, unless defined herein, shall have the same meaning as \nhave been assigned to them under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 or the \nReserve Bank of India Act, 1934 or any statutory modification or re-enactment \nthereto or any other relevant regulation or as used in commercial parlance, as \nthe case may be. \nGeneral Guidelines  \n10. Each RE under a CLA shall be required to retain a minimum 10 per cent share \nof the individual loans in its books.  \n11. The credit policy of a RE shall suitably incorporate provisions relating to CLAs, \nincluding the internal limit for the proportion of their lending portfolio under \nCLAs; target borrower segments; due diligence of the partner entities; customer \nservice and grievance redressal mechanism. \nPage 4 of 8 \n \n12. The agreement to be entered between the CLA partners shall include detailed \nterms and conditions of the arrangement; the criteria for selection of borrowers; \nspecific product lines and areas of operation; fees payable for lending \nservices1, if any; provisions related to segregation of responsibilities; time-\nframe for exchanging critical information; customer interface and customer \nprotection issues and grievance redressal mechanism.  \n13. The loan agreement signed with the borrower shall make an upfront disclosure \nregarding the segregation of the roles and responsibilities (such as sourcing, \nand servicing) of concerned REs, including clear identification of the entity \nbeing the single point of interface with the customer. Any subsequent change \nin customer interface shall only be done after prior intimation to the borrower. \nThe loan-agreement shall also appropriately disclose suitable provisions \nrelated to customer protection, and grievance redressal mechanism. \n14.
