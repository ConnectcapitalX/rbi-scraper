Process of registration in e-Kuber system \nFirstly, a bank needs to register under the DEA Fund module on e-Kuber system.

A \nbank, which is yet to complete the registration process shall arrange to complete it \nexpeditiously. \n \n2. Authorised signatories of a bank \nA bank shall identify officers (authorised signatories) to operate the bank\u2019s DEA Fund account \njointly, who shall be responsible for authorising the applicable returns (Form-I, Form-II and \nRectification Forms as hereinafter detailed in the circular) under the DEA Fund Scheme.

Procedure for transferring the unclaimed amount to the Fund  \n3.1 A bank shall transfer to the DEA Fund (the Fund), the amounts becoming due in each \ncalendar month (i.e., proceeds of the inoperative accounts and balances remaining unclaimed \nfor 10 years or more) as specified in the Scheme, and the interest accrued on interest bearing \naccounts till the date of transfer, during the last five working days of the subsequent month. \nBefore transferring the amount due to the Fund, the bank shall ensure that all legal obligations \nrelating to the same, till that date, including those pertaining to taxes deductible and payable, \nare met or adequate arrangements are made therefor. \n \n3 \n \n \n \n3.2 Own account - A member bank shall transfer to the Fund, the entire amount due through \ne-Kuber system under the module \u201cDEA Fund Services\u201d. When a member bank is crediting \namount due to the Fund, it shall furnish its DEA Fund Code in the \u201cBank DEA Fund Code\u201d field \nand the detailed breakup (number of accounts and amount) of the deposits, viz., interest \nbearing deposits, non-interest bearing deposits and other credits, which  also includes non-\ninterest bearing amount (i.e., any amount other than deposits remaining unclaimed as defined \nin paragraph 3(iii) of the Scheme), in the fields provided for the same in the e-Kuber system.  \n \n3.3 Other bank\u2019s (non-member) account - In case, a sponsor bank is remitting the amounts \ndue of other non-member banks, it shall not consolidate but separately remit the amount bank-\nwise to the Fund, by indicating appropriate Bank DEA Fund Code of the other (non-member) \nbank in the field provided in the e-Kuber. They should also provide the detailed break-up \n(number of accounts and amount) of the deposits, viz., interest-bearing deposits, non-interest \nbearing deposits and other credits in the respective fields, i.e., the fields designated for the \nsame, in the e-Kuber system.  \n \n4. Window for transferring unclaimed amount and submission of claim \n4.1 Deposit Window for transferring unclaimed amount \nThe window for transferring unclaimed amounts/deposits to the Fund through e-Kuber shall be \nkept open only during the last five working days of every month, and a bank (including the non-\nmember bank) is permitted to effect only one transfer of unclaimed amounts per month. A non-\nmember bank is advised to transfer the unclaimed amounts/deposits to its sponsor bank \n(through normal banking channel), sufficiently in advance of the due date, to enable the sponsor \nbank to transfer the same to the Fund through e-Kuber system. On receipt of the amount \ntransferred to the Fund, an auto generated acknowledgement receipt will be directly sent from \ne-Kuber system to the registered e-mail ids of the bank.  \n \n4.2 Claim Window for submission of claim \nThe window for submitting claim from the Fund shall be kept open in e-Kuber system during \nthe first 10 working days of every month. A bank shall submit only one consolidated claim per \nmonth. A non-member bank is advised to submit the claim to its sponsor bank sufficiently in \nadvance of the due date, to enable the sponsor bank to submit the same to RBI through e-\nKuber system. \n \n \n4 \n \n \n4.3 A bank is required to transfer the unclaimed amounts/deposits due to the Fund and submit \nthe claims, within the stipulated timeframe. It should also ensure correctness of the amount \ntransferred to/claimed from the Fund.  \n \n5. Procedure for submitting claim refund - Form II \n5.1 In terms of paragraph 4 (i) of the Scheme, in case of demand from a customer/depositor, \nwhose unclaimed amount/deposit had been transferred to Fund, a bank shall repay the \ncustomer/depositor, along with interest, if applicable, and thereafter, lodge a claim for refund \nfrom the Fund for an equivalent amount paid to the customer/depositor. In case of any claim \nmade by the customer/depositor for refund of only part amount, the bank shall repay the \ncustomer accordingly by making the account operative and keep the remaining amount \n(including the interest, if any) in the account, and thereafter lodge a claim for the entire amount \nfrom the Fund. Banks may refer to RBI\u2019s circular DOR.SOG (LEG).REC/64/09.08.024/2023-24 \ndated January 1, 2024 on Inoperative Accounts/Unclaimed Deposits in Banks - Revised \nInstructions, wherein operational guidelines on activation of inoperative accounts have been \nissued.  \n \n5.2 On submission of claim, an auto generated Form II (Annex IV) from the e-Kuber system \nwill be sent to the registered e-mail ids of the banks/non-member banks.

The bank/non-member bank shall \nalso submit a copy of the latest half-year Form III (Reconciliation Certificate-Annex V) and \nAnnual Certificate (Annex VI), while submitting the first claim during the half-year / year, as the \ncase may be, along with the claim form - Form II, else it will result in non-consideration of claim \nof the bank.  \n  \n5.3 The claim will be examined by RBI. If the claim is in order, the claimed amount will be \ncredited to the account of the member bank (with the sponsor bank in case of a non-member \nbank) maintained with RBI by the end of the same month. The claim settlement/rejection advice \nwill be sent to the respective bank on their registered e-mail ids. While making payment towards \nclaims from the Fund to a non-member bank, the RBI will credit the account of the sponsor \nbank. The sponsor bank is required to credit the same to the non-member bank. \n \n5.4 The claims will be processed by the RBI based on the information provided by a bank in \nForm II. Therefore, the onus of making correct refund claims from the Fund will solely lie with \nthe bank.  \n \n5 \n \n \n \n5.5 A bank is not required to provide the customer-wise details in case of refund claims in Form \nII. It should, however, maintain the customer-wise details of claims at its end, duly certified by \nits bank\u2019s auditors (internal/concurrent), which RBI may seek at a later stage/during the \nsupervisory review process. \n \n5.6 Proper due diligence as required under RBI\u2019s Master Direction - Know Your Customer \n(KYC) Direction, 2016 (as amended from time to time) should also be carried out before making \npayments to customers. A bank should verify the genuineness of the claims while making the \nprocess smoother and hassle free for the customers. \n \n5.7 Interest payable on unclaimed interest bearing deposit - The rate of interest, if any, \npayable (by a bank to its depositors/claimants) on the principal amount of unclaimed interest-\nbearing deposit amount transferred to the Fund, shall be specified by the Reserve Bank of India \nfrom time to time, as envisaged in the paragraph 4 (iii) of the Scheme.

Submission of Returns \nThe following returns have been prescribed to the banks in terms of paragraph 5 of the Scheme. \n \n6.1 Form I - Monthly Statement  \n6.1.1 At the end of every month, the e-Kuber system will auto generate a Form I (Annex III) \nfor each bank (including non-member banks) and send it to their registered e-mail ids, including \nthose banks which have not transferred any deposits. A bank (or sponsor bank on behalf of its \nnon-member bank), after verifying the correctness of Form I, is required to submit the same \nonline to RBI through e-Kuber system.  \n \n6.1.2 The auto generated Form I is confirmed only if the bank (sponsor bank in case of non-\nmember bank) agrees with the balances shown in Form I by ticking the two check-boxes on \nthe screen of e-Kuber system a) \u201cI Agree\u201d and b) \u201cForm has been duly audited by bank\u2019s \nauditors (internal/concurrent)\u201d.

In terms of \nparagraph II (9) of the aforesaid Licensing Guidelines, a small finance bank (SFB) is \nrequired to extend 75 per cent of its Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) to the sectors \neligible for classification as priority sector lending (PSL) by the Reserve Bank. Further, \nwhile 40 per cent of its ANBC should be allocated to different sub-sectors under PSL \nas per the extant PSL prescriptions, the bank can allocate the balance 35 per cent to \nany one or more sub-sectors under the PSL where it has competitive advantage. \n \nRevised provisions \n \n2. On a review, it has been decided that financial year 2025-26 onwards, the additional \ncomponent (35 per cent) of PSL shall be reduced to 20 per cent, thereby making the \noverall PSL target as 60 per cent of ANBC or Credit Equivalent of Off-Balance Sheet \nExposures (CEOBE), whichever is higher. The SFB shall continue to allocate 40 per \ncent of its ANBC or CEOBE, whichever is higher, to different sub-sectors under PSL \nas per the extant PSL prescriptions, while the balance 20 per cent shall be allocated \nto any one or more sub-sectors under the PSL where the bank has competitive \nadvantage. \n \n3. These instructions are issued in exercise of the powers conferred on the Reserve \nBank of India under Section 22 (1) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.  \nYours faithfully,  \n \n \n \n(Manoranjan Padhy)  \nChief General Manager \n",

The \nPrudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets issued on June 7, 2019, as \nupdated from time to time, (\u2018Prudential Framework\u2019) provides a comprehensive \nframework for early recognition and resolution of stress in borrower accounts. \nHowever, restructuring of exposures relating to projects under implementation on \naccount of change in date of commencement of commercial operations (DCCO) was \nexcluded from the ambit of the Prudential Framework, pending further review. \nBased on a comprehensive review of the regulatory norms and taking into account the \nexperience of banks with regard to financing of project loans, it has been decided to \nrationalise the extant guidelines and harmonise the same for all regulated entities \n(REs) which undertake project finance.  \nII. \nPreliminary  \n \nA. Preamble \n \n1. These Directions are issued to provide a harmonised framework for financing of \nprojects in infrastructure and non-infrastructure (including commercial real estate \n& commercial real estate- residential housing) sectors by REs. These Directions \nalso lay down the revised regulatory treatment upon change in the DCCO of such \nprojects in the backdrop of a review of the extant instructions and analysis of the \nrisks inherent in such financing.  \nB. Powers Exercised \n \n2. In exercise of the powers conferred by Sections 21 and 35A of Banking Regulation \nAct, 1949 read with Section 56 of the Act ibid; Chapter IIIB of the Reserve Bank of \nIndia Act, 1934; Section 30A of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987, read with \nSection 32 and Section 33 of the Act ibid; the Reserve Bank of India (hereinafter \ncalled the Reserve Bank), being satisfied that it is necessary and expedient in \npublic interest to do so, hereby, issues these Directions hereinafter specified. \n \n \n3 \n \nC.

For all projects financed by a lender, it shall be ensured that: \n(a) Financial closure has been achieved and original DCCO is clearly spelt out \nand documented prior to disbursement of funds.  \n(b) The project specific disbursement schedule vis-\u00e0-vis stage of completion of \nthe project is included in the loan agreement.  \n(c) The post DCCO repayment schedule has been realistically designed to \nfactor in the initial cash flows.  \n \n8 \n \nProvided that, the original or revised repayment tenor, including the \nmoratorium period, if any, shall not exceed 85% of the economic life of \na project. \n14. For a given project, original/extended/actual DCCO, as the case may be, shall be \nsame across all lenders to the project.  \n15. In under-construction projects where the aggregate exposure of the lenders is up \nto \u20b91,500 crores, no individual lender shall have an exposure which is less than \n10% of the aggregate exposure. For projects where aggregate exposure of all \nlenders is more than \u20b91,500 crores, the exposure floor for an individual lender shall \nbe 5% or \u20b9150 crores, whichever is higher.  \nProvided that, the above minimum exposure requirements shall not apply post-\nactual DCCO and lenders may freely acquire from or sell exposures to other \nlenders, in compliance with guidelines contained in the Master Direction on \nTransfer of Loan Exposures as updated from time to time. Prior to actual DCCO, \nlenders may acquire from or sell exposures to other lenders under a syndication \narrangement4, provided the share of individual lenders is in adherence to the above \nlimits.  \n16.  A \nlender \nshall \nensure \nthat \nall \napplicable \napprovals/clearances \nfor \nimplementing/constructing the project are obtained before financial closure. An \nindicative list of such pre-requisite approvals/clearances includes environmental \nclearance, legal clearance, regulatory clearances, etc., as applicable to the project.  \n \n17. Approvals/clearances which are contingent upon achievement of certain \nmilestones in terms of project completion would be deemed to be applicable only \nwhen such milestones are achieved. For example, consent to operate a boiler can \nonly be applied for after the construction of a boiler. Hence, the same would not be \ntreated as an applicable mandatory pre-requisite at the time of financial closure. \n \n   \n                                                          \n \n4 As specified under Master Direction on Transfer of Loan Exposures as updated from time to time \n \n9 \n \nI. Prudential Conditions Related to Disbursement and Monitoring \n \n18. A lender shall ensure availability of sufficient land/right of way for all projects before \ndisbursement of funds, subject to the following minimum requirements: \n(a) For infrastructure projects under PPP model \u2013 50%   \n(b) For all other projects (non-PPP infrastructure, and non-infrastructure \nincluding CRE & CRE-RH) \u2013 75%  \n(c) For transmission line projects \u2013 as decided by a lender \n19. In case of infrastructure projects under PPP model, disbursement of funds shall \nbegin only after declaration of the Appointed date or its equivalent, for the project. \nHowever, in cases where non-fund based credit facilities may be mandated by the \nconcession granting authority as a pre-requisite for declaration of appointed date,  \na lender may sanction such credit facilities, in adherence with the extant regulatory \ninstructions on non-fund based facilities.  \n20. Further, in respect of the exposures mentioned at paragraph 19 above, the original \nDCCO documented in the financial closure document may be modified to reflect \nany change in the \u2018Appointed Date\u2019 by the Concession granting authority prior to \ndisbursement of funds by way of a supplementary agreement between a lender \nand the debtor subject to reassessment of project viability and obtention of sanction \nfrom appropriate authorities. A Techno-Economic Viability (TEV) study shall be \nrequired for this purpose for all projects where the aggregate exposure of all \nlenders is \u20b9100 crores or more. \n21. A lender shall ensure that disbursal is proportionate to the stages of completion of \nthe project as also to the progress in equity infusion and other sources of finance, \nagreed as part of financial closure and receipt of remaining applicable clearances. \nThe lender\u2019s Independent Engineer (LIE)/Architect shall certify the stages of \ncompletion of the project.  \n22. A project finance account may be classified as NPA during any time before actual \nDCCO as per record of recovery, in terms of  Master Circular - Prudential norms \non Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to \nAdvances dated April 01, 2025, as updated from time to time or the relevant \ninstructions as applicable to specific category of lenders. \n \n10 \n \nIV. \nPrudential Norms for Resolution  \n \nJ. Resolution of Stress \n23. A lender shall monitor the performance of the project and any buildup of stress on \nan ongoing basis and shall be expected to initiate a resolution plan well in advance. \nOccurrence of a credit event with any of the lenders during the construction phase, \nshall trigger a collective resolution in terms of the Prudential Framework5. The \nreference to \u2018default\u2019 in the Prudential Framework shall be read as \u2018credit event\u2019 for \nthe purpose of project finance accounts, unless specified otherwise.  \n24. Any such credit event shall be reported to the Central Repository of Information on \nLarge Credit (CRILC) by the lender in the prescribed weekly as well as the CRILC-\nMain report in compliance with the extant instructions, as applicable. A lender in a \nconsortium/multiple lending arrangement shall also report occurrence of such \ncredit event to all other members of the consortium/multiple lending arrangement. \nThe instructions on CRILC reporting shall be issued in due course. \n25. A lender shall undertake a prima facie review of the debtor account within thirty \ndays from the date of such credit event (\u201cReview Period\u201d). The conduct of the \nlender(s) during this Review Period, including signing of Inter Creditor Agreement \n(ICA), and the decision to implement a resolution plan, wherever required, shall be \nguided by the provisions of the Prudential Framework5, unless specified otherwise \nin these Directions.  \nK. Resolution Plans Involving Extension of Original / Extended DCCO \n \n26. A project finance account classified as standard and that satisfies all relevant \nprudential conditions specified in Chapter III of these Directions, where a resolution \nplan involving extension of original/ extended DCCO, as the case maybe, is \nimplemented, shall continue to be classified as \u2018Standard\u2019, provided the envisaged \nresolution plan ab initio conforms to the conditions stipulated hereunder: \n                                                          \n \n5 While the Prudential Framework is otherwise not applicable to certain categories of Lender(s) to which these \nDirections are addressed, all the norms applicable to implementation of a resolution plan, and specific \nimplementation conditions, as laid out in the Prudential Framework shall be applicable to all Lender(s) for any \nresolution plan implemented under this facility. \n \n11 \n \n(a) Permitted DCCO Deferment \u2013 Original / extended DCCO, as the case may \nbe, is extended, along with the consequential shift in repayment schedule \nfor equal or shorter duration (including the start date and end date of revised \nrepayment schedule), within the following time limits: \n \nInfrastructure \nProjects \nNon-Infrastructure Projects \n(including CRE and CRE-RH6) \nPermitted deferment of DCCO \nfrom the original DCCO  \nUpto 3 years  \nUpto 2 years  \n \n(b) Cost Overrun \u2013 A lender may finance, as part of a resolution plan, cost \noverrun associated with permitted DCCO deferment in compliance with \nparagraph 26(a) above, and classify the account as \u2018Standard\u2019, as under: \n(i) Cost overrun up to a maximum of 10% of the original project cost, in \naddition to IDC. \n(ii) Cost overrun is financed through SBCF specifically sanctioned by the \nlender at the time of financial closure7.  \n(iii) For infrastructure projects,  in cases where SBCF was not sanctioned at \nthe time of financial closure, or was sanctioned but not renewed \nsubsequently, such additional funding shall be priced at a premium to \nwhat would have been applicable on a pre-sanctioned SBCF. Lenders \nshall ensure that the loan-contracts ab-initio specify the additional risk \npremium to be charged on such SBCF, which may be revised upwards \nbased on actual risk assessment at the time of sanction of such facilities.  \n(iv) The financial parameters like D/E ratio, external credit rating8  (if any) \netc. remain unchanged or are enhanced in favour of the lender post such \ncost overrun funding. \n                                                          \n \n6 For CRE and CRE-RH projects, all provisions of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (as \nupdated from time to time) are to be complied with. \n7 The facility has been sanctioned at the time of financial closure and has been renewed continuously without \nany gap till the draw down under the facility. \n8 For projects where aggregate exposure of all lenders is less than \u20b9100 crore, internal credit rating may be \nconsidered, provided the project was originally not credit rated externally. \n \n12 \n \n(c) Change in Scope and Size \u2013 A project finance account where DCCO \nextension is necessitated by an increase in the project outlay on account of \nincrease in scope and size of the project, may be classified as \u2018Standard\u2019, \nsubject to complying with the following conditions: \n(i) The rise in project cost excluding any cost-overrun in respect of the \noriginal project is 25% or more of the original outlay as the case may \nbe (Illustration given in Annex 1). \n(ii) A lender re-assesses the viability of the project before approving the \nenhancement of scope and fixing a fresh DCCO. \n(iii) On re-rating (if already rated), the new external credit rating is not \nbelow the previous external credit rating by more than one notch.  \nIf the project debt was unrated at the time of increase in scope or \nsize, then it should be externally rated investment grade upon such \nincrease in scope or size in case of projects where aggregate \nexposure of all lenders is equal to or greater than \u20b9100 crores. \nThe standard asset classification benefit on account of \u2018change in scope\u2019 \nshall be allowed only once during the lifetime of the project.  \n27. Further, in all the above cases, the following conditions shall be required to be met \nbefore the expiry of 180 days from the end of the Review Period, for successful \nimplementation of a resolution plan: \ni. all required documentation, including execution of necessary agreements \nbetween a lender and the debtor/ creation of security charge/ perfection of \nsecurities, are completed in consonance with the resolution plan being \nimplemented. \nii. the new capital structure and/ or changes in the financing agreement get duly \nreflected in the books of a lender and the debtor. \n28. If the resolution plan involving change in DCCO is not successfully implemented in \nterms of paragraph 26 and/or 27 above, then the account shall be downgraded to \nNPA immediately. \n \n13 \n \nL. Criteria for Upgradation \n  \n29. A project finance account downgraded to NPA for non-compliance with paragraph \n26 above, can be upgraded only after the account performs satisfactorily9 post \nactual DCCO.  \n30. A project finance account downgraded to NPA for non-compliance with paragraph \n27 above, can be upgraded on successful implementation of resolution plan, \nprovided no further request for DCCO deferment is received.  \nM. Income Recognition  \n31. A lender may recognise income on accrual basis in respect of project finance \nexposures which are classified as \u2018Standard\u2019. For NPAs, income recognition shall \nbe as per extant instructions contained in Master Circular - Prudential norms on \nIncome Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to Advances \ndated April 01, 2025, as updated from time to time or the relevant instructions as \napplicable to specific category of lenders. \nN. Provisioning for Standard Assets  \n32. For project finance exposures, a lender shall maintain a general provision at the \nfollowing rates for the funded outstanding on a portfolio basis: \n \nConstruction Phase \nOperational Phase \u2013 after \ncommencement of \nrepayment of interest and \nprincipal  \nCRE \n1.25% \n1.00% \nCRE-RH \n1.00% \n0.75% \nAll others \n1.00% \n0.40% \n \nO. Provisioning for DCCO Deferred Standard Assets \n33. For accounts which have availed DCCO deferment as per Part K of these \nDirections and are classified as \u2018standard\u2019, lenders shall maintain additional \nspecific provisions of 0.375% for infrastructure project loans and 0.5625% for non-\ninfrastructure project loans (including CRE and CRE-RH), for each quarter of \n                                                          \n \n9 Satisfactory performance as defined in Prudential Framework or the relevant instructions as applicable to \nspecific category of lenders where the Prudential Framework is not applicable. \n \n14 \n \ndeferment, over and above the applicable standard asset provision specified at \nparagraph 32 above (illustration given in Annex 2). These additional specific \nprovisions shall be reversed upon commencement of commercial operation.  \nP. Provisioning for Existing Projects  \n34. The provisions stipulated in paragraph 32 and 33 shall not be applicable for existing \nprojects which are specified under paragraph 7 of Part E of these Directions. Such \nproject loans shall continue to be guided by the existing prudential guidelines for \nthe purpose of provisioning, which otherwise shall be treated as repealed.  \n35. In case of any resolution of a fresh credit event and/or change in material terms \nand conditions in the loan contract in such projects, subsequent to the effective \ndate, the provisions stipulated at paragraph 32 and 33 shall apply to these projects \nas if these were sanctioned post the effective date.  \nQ. Provisioning for Non-Performing Assets  \n36. Provisioning for project loans classified as NPA shall be as per extant instructions \ncontained in Master Circular - Prudential norms on Income Recognition, Asset \nClassification and Provisioning pertaining to Advances dated April 01, 2025, as \nupdated from time to time or the relevant instructions as applicable to specific \ncategory of lenders.  \nV. \nMiscellaneous \n \nR. Creation and Maintenance of Database \n37. Project specific data, in electronic and easily accessible format, shall be captured \nand maintained by lenders on an ongoing basis. A list of the relevant parameters \nwhich shall form part of project finance database, at a minimum, is given in Annex \n3 to these Directions. A lender shall update any change in parameters of a project \nfinance exposure at the earliest, but not later than 15 days from such change. The \nnecessary system in this regard shall be put in place within 3 months of the \neffective date. \n \n \n \n15 \n \nS. Disclosures \n \n38. Lender shall make appropriate disclosures in their financial statements, under \n\u2018Notes to Accounts\u2019, relating to resolution plans implemented. The format for \ndisclosure is given in Annex 4.  \nT. Penal Consequences for Non-compliance \n39. Non-compliance with any of the provisions contained in these Directions shall \nattract supervisory and enforcement action as applicable. \nU. Repeal Provisions \n40. With these Directions coming into force, the instructions/guidelines contained in \nAnnex 5, will stand repealed as of the effective date.   \n41. Notwithstanding the repeal provisions under paragraph 40 above, anything done \nor any action taken or purported to have been done or taken, or any direction given \nor any proceeding taken or any penalty or fine imposed under the repealed \nenactments shall, insofar as it is not inconsistent with the provisions of these \nDirections, be deemed to have been done or taken under the corresponding \nprovisions of these  Directions. \n********* \n \n \n \n \n16 \n \nAnnex 1 \nIllustration for computation of increase in project cost \nIllustration 1 \nOriginal cost of the Project \u2013 \u20b91,000 crore \nRevised cost of the Project \u2013 \u20b91,200 crore \nIncrease in cost \u2013 \u20b9200 crore i.e., 20% \nAttribution of increase in cost  \na.

Please do not respond in any manner to such offers. \n \n \n2 \n \nMaster Circular - Credit Facilities to Scheduled Castes (SCs) & Scheduled Tribes \n(STs) \n \nBanks should take the measures indicated below to step up their advances to \nSCs/STs.  \n \n1. Planning Process \n \n1.1 The District Level Consultative Committees formed under the Lead Bank Scheme \nshould continue to be the principal mechanism of co-ordination between banks and \ndevelopment agencies in this regard. The district credit plans formulated by the Lead \nBanks should clearly indicate the linkage of credit with employment and development \nschemes. \n \n1.2 Banks will have to establish closer liaison with the District Industries Centres, \nwhich have been set up in different districts for promoting self-employment. \n \n1.3 At the block level, a certain weightage is to be given to SCs/STs in the planning \nprocess. Accordingly, the credit planning should be weighted in their favour and \nspecial bankable schemes suited to them should be drawn up to ensure their \nparticipation and larger flow of credit to them for self-employment. It will be necessary \nfor the banks to consider their loan proposals with utmost sympathy and \nunderstanding. \n \n1.4 Banks should periodically review their lending procedures and policies to see that \nloans are sanctioned in time, are adequate and production-oriented and that they \ngenerate incremental income to make them self-liquidating.  \n \n1.5 While formulating the Block/ District Credit Plan, special focus may be given to \nvillages with sizeable population of SC/ST communities/ specific localities (bastis) in \nthe towns/villages having a concentration of these communities.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \n2. Role of Banks \n \n2.1 Bank staff may help the borrowers in filling up the forms and completing other \nformalities so that they are able to get credit facility within a stipulated period from the \ndate of receipt of applications.  \n \n2.2 In order to encourage SC/ST borrowers to take advantage of credit facilities, \ngreater awareness among them about various schemes formulated by banks needs \nto be created through various means such as brochures, visits by field staff etc so that \nsalient features of the schemes, as also the advantages that will accrue to them are \nknown to such borrowers. Banks should advise their branches to organize meetings \nmore frequently exclusively for SC/ST beneficiaries to understand their credit needs \nand to incorporate the same in the credit plan. \n \n2.3 Circulars issued by RBI/NABARD should be circulated among the staff for \ncompliance.  \n \n2.4 Banks should not insist on deposits while considering loan applications under \nGovernment sponsored poverty alleviation schemes/self-employment programmes \nfrom borrowers belonging to SCs/STs. It should also be ensured that applicable \nsubsidy is not held back while releasing the loan component till the full repayment of \nbank dues. Non-release of subsidy upfront amounts to under-financing and hampers \nasset creation/income generation. \n \n2.5 The National Scheduled Tribes Finance & Development Corporation and National \nScheduled Castes Finance & Development Corporation have been set up under the \nadministrative control of Ministry of Tribal Affairs and Ministry of Social Justice & \nEmpowerment, respectively. Banks should advise their branches/controlling offices to \nrender all the necessary institutional support to enable these institutions to achieve \nthe desired objectives. \n \n2.6. Loans sanctioned to State Sponsored Organisations for Scheduled Castes/ \nScheduled Tribes for the specific purpose of purchase and supply of inputs and/or the \nmarketing of the outputs of the beneficiaries of these organisations are eligible for \npriority sector classification. \n \n \n \n4 \n \n2.7 Rejection of SC/STs\u2019 loan applications under government programmes should be \ndone at the next higher level instead of at the branch level and reasons of rejection \nshould be clearly indicated. \n \n3. Role of SC/ST Development Corporations \n \nThe Government of India has advised all State Governments that the Scheduled \nCaste/Scheduled Tribes Development Corporations can consider bankable \nschemes/proposals for bank finance. \n \n4. Reservations for SC/ST beneficiaries under major Centrally Sponsored \nSchemes. \nThere are several major centrally sponsored schemes under which credit is provided \nby banks and subsidy is received through Government Agencies. Credit flow under \nthese schemes is monitored by RBI. Under each of these, there is a significant \nreservation/relaxation for the members of the SC/ST communities. \n4.1 Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) \n \n \n \nDAY-NRLM (previously known as NRLM) was launched by the Ministry of Rural \nDevelopment, Government of India by restructuring the erstwhile Swarnajayanti Gram \nSwarozgar Yojana, effective from April 1, 2013. DAY-NRLM would ensure adequate \ncoverage of vulnerable sections of the society such that 50% of these beneficiaries \nare SCs/STs. Details of the scheme are available in the Master Circular on DAY-NRLM \nas updated from time to time. \n \n4.2 Differential Rate of Interest (DRI) Scheme \n \nUnder the DRI Scheme, banks provide finance up to \u20b915,000/- at a concessional rate \nof interest of 4 per cent per annum to the weaker sections of the community for \nengaging in productive and gainful activities. In order to ensure that persons belonging \nto SCs/STs also derive adequate benefit under the DRI Scheme, banks have been \nadvised to grant eligible borrowers belonging to SCs/STs such advances to the extent \nof not less than 2/5th (40 percent) of total DRI advances. Further, the eligibility criteria \nunder DRI, viz. size of land holding should not exceed 1 acre of irrigated land and 2.5  \nacres of unirrigated land, are not applicable to SCs/STs. Members of SCs/STs \nsatisfying the income criteria of the scheme can also avail of housing loan up to \n \n \n5 \n \n\u20b920,000/- per beneficiary over and above the individual loan of \u20b915,000/- available \nunder the scheme. \n \n \n5. Credit Enhancement Guarantee Scheme for Scheduled Castes (CEGSSC) \nThe CEGSSC was launched by Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment on May 6, \n2015 with the objective of promoting entrepreneurship amongst the Scheduled Castes \n(SCs), by providing credit enhancement guarantee to Member Lending Institutions \n(MLIs), which extend financial assistance to these entrepreneurs. IFCI Ltd. has been \ndesignated as the Nodal Agency under the scheme, to issue the guarantee cover in \nfavour of MLIs for financing SC entrepreneurs. \n \nIndividual SC entrepreneurs/Registered Companies and Societies/Registered \nPartnership Firms/Sole Proprietorship firms having more than 51% shareholding and \nmanagement control for the previous 6 months by SC entrepreneurs/ promoters/ \nmembers are eligible for guarantee from IFCI Ltd. against the loans extended by MLIs.  \n \nThe amount of guarantee cover under CEGSSC ranges from a minimum of \u20b90.15 cr \nto a maximum of \u20b95.00 cr. \n \nThe tenure of guarantee is up to a maximum of 7 years or repayment period, whichever \nis earlier. \n \n6. Monitoring and Review \n \n6.1 A special cell should be set up at the Head Office of banks for monitoring the flow \nof credit to SC/ST beneficiaries. Apart from ensuring the implementation of the RBI \nguidelines, the cell would also be responsible for collection of relevant information/data \nfrom the branches, consolidation thereof and submission of the requisite returns to \nRBI and Government. \n \n6.2 The Head Office of banks should periodically review the credit extended to \nSCs/STs on the basis of returns and other data received from the branches. Any major \ngap or variation in credit flow to SCs/STs on a year to year basis should be reported \nto the Board as part of the review on the theme of \u201cFinancial Inclusion\u201d in terms of \ncircular DBR No.BC.93/29.67.001/2014-15 dated May 14, 2015.  \n \n \n \n6 \n \n6.3 Banks should review the measures taken to enhance the flow of credit to SC/ST \nborrowers on a quarterly basis. The review should also consider the progress made \nin lending to these communities directly or through the State Level Scheduled \nCaste/Scheduled Tribe Corporations for various purposes based, amongst others, on \nfield visits of the senior officers from the Head Office/Controlling Offices. \n \n6.4 SLBC Convenor bank should invite the representative of National Commission for \nSCs/STs to attend SLBC meetings. Besides, the Convenor bank may also invite \nrepresentatives from the National Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Finance \nand Development Corporation (NSFDC) and State Scheduled Castes and Scheduled \nTribes Finance and Development Corporation (SCDC) to attend SLBC meetings.  \n \n7. Reporting Requirements \n \nData on advances to SCs and STs should be reported as prescribed in the Master \nDirection on Priority Sector Lending as updated from time to time, within the time \nframes stipulated. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                    Appendix \nCredit Facilities to Scheduled Castes / Scheduled Tribes \nList of Circulars Consolidated in the Master Circular \n \n \nNo. \nCircular No. \nDate \nSubject \n1. \nDBOD.No.BP.BC.172/C.464(R)-78  \nDecember 12, \n1978 \nRole \nof \nBanks \nin \nPromoting \nEmployment  \n2. \nDBOD.No.BP.BC.8/C.453(K)-Gen   \nJanuary 09, 1979 Agricultural \nCredit \nto \nSmall \nand \nMarginal Farmers  \n3. \nDBOD.No.BP.BC.45/C.469(86)-81    \nApril 14, 1981 \nCredit Facilities to SC / ST  \n4. \nDBOD.No.BP.BC.132/C.594-81 \nOctober 22, 1981 Recommendations of the Working \nGroup \non \nthe \nDevelopment \nof \nScheduled Castes  \n5. \nRPCD.No.PS.BC.2/C.594-82   \nSeptember 10, \n1982 \nCredit Facilities to SC / ST  \n6. \nRPCD.No.PS.BC.9/C.594-82   \nNovember 05, \n1982 \nConcessional Bank Finance to SC / ST \nDevelopment Corporations  \n7. \nRPCD.No.PS.BC.4/C. 594-83   \nAugust 22, 1983 \nCredit Facilities to SC / ST  \n8. \nRPCD.No.PS.BC.20/C.568(A)-84   \nJanuary 24, 1984 Credit Facilities to SC / ST - Rejection \nof Loan Applications  \n9. \nRPCD.No. CONFS.62/PB-1-85/86   \nJuly 24, 1985 \nRole of Private Sector Banks in \nLending to SCs / STs  \n10.
