However, Reserve Bank\u2019s supervisory reviews have indicated \ndivergent practices amongst Regulated Entities (REs) with regard to levy of pre-payment \ncharges in case of loans sanctioned to MSEs which lead to customer grievances and \ndisputes. Further, certain REs have been found to include restrictive clauses in loan \ncontracts/ agreements to deter borrowers from switching over to another lender, either \nfor availing lower rates of interest or better terms of service. Accordingly, as announced \nin the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies dated October 9, 2024, a \ndraft circular in this regard was issued on February 21, 2025 for public consultation. \n2. Based on a review of the supervisory findings and public feedback received on the \ndraft circular, the Reserve Bank, in exercise of the powers conferred by Sections 21, 35A \nand 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, Sections 45JA, 45L and 45M of the Reserve \nBank of India Act, 1934 and Section 30A of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987, hereby \nissues the Directions hereinafter specified.  \n \n3.(i) These Directions shall be called the Reserve Bank of India (Pre-payment Charges \non Loans) Directions, 2025. \n(ii) These Directions shall be applicable to all loans2 and advances sanctioned or \nrenewed on or after January 1, 2026.  \n \n                                                            \n1 As defined in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006 \n2 The term \u2018loans\u2019, for the purpose of this circular, shall include term loans as well as demand loans \n2 \n \n4. These Directions shall apply to all commercial banks (excluding payments banks), co-\noperative banks, NBFCs and All India Financial Institutions.  \n \n5. An RE shall adhere to the following Directions regarding levy of pre-payment charges \non all floating rate loans and advances: \n(i)  For all loans granted for purposes other than business to individuals, with or without \nco-obligant(s), an RE shall not levy pre-payment charges;  \n(ii) For all loans granted for business purpose to individuals and MSEs, with or without \nco-obligant(s):  \n(a) A commercial bank (excluding Small Finance bank, Regional Rural bank and \nLocal Area bank), a Tier 4 Primary (Urban) Co-operative bank, an NBFC-UL, and \nan All India Financial Institution shall not levy any pre-payment charges.  \n(b) A Small Finance bank, a Regional Rural bank, a Tier 3 Primary (Urban) Co-\noperative bank, State Cooperative bank, Central Cooperative bank and an NBFC-\nML shall not levy any pre-payment charges on loans with sanctioned amount/ limit \nup to \u20b950 lakh. \n(iii) The Directions at paragraphs 5(i) and 5(ii) above shall be applicable irrespective of \nthe source of funds used for pre-payment of loans, either in part or in full, and without any \nminimum lock-in period. \n(iv) Applicability of above Directions for dual/ special rate (combination of fixed and \nfloating rate) loans will depend on whether the loan is on floating rate at the time of pre-\npayment.  \n \n6. In cases other than those mentioned at paragraphs 5(i) and 5(ii) above, pre-payment \ncharges, if any, shall be as per the approved policy of the RE. However, in case of term \nloans, pre-payment charges, if levied by the RE, shall be based on the amount being \nprepaid. In case of cash credit/ overdraft facilities, pre-payment charges on closure of the \nfacility before the due date shall be levied on an amount not exceeding the sanctioned \nlimit. \n \n7. In case of cash credit/ overdraft facilities, no pre-payment charges shall be applicable \nif the borrower intimates the RE of his/ her/ its intention not to renew the facility before \nthe period as stipulated in the loan agreement, provided that the facility gets closed on \n3 \n \nthe due date. \n \n8. An RE shall not levy any charges where pre-payment is effected at the instance of the \nRE. \n \n9. The applicability or otherwise of pre-payment charges shall be clearly disclosed in the \nsanction letter and loan agreement. Further, in case of loans and advances where Key \nFacts Statement (KFS) is to be provided as specified in the Reserve Bank\u2019s circular dated \nApril 15, 2024 on \u2018Key Facts Statement for Loans and Advances\u2019, the same shall also be \nmentioned in the KFS. No pre-payment charges which have not been disclosed as \nspecified herein shall be charged by an RE. \n \n10. An RE shall not levy any charges/ fees retrospectively at the time of pre-payment of \nloans, which were waived off earlier by the RE. \n \n11. Repeal Provisions \nWith the issue of these Directions, the instructions contained in the circulars/ Master \nDirections mentioned in Annex, issued by the Reserve Bank, shall stand repealed from \nthe effective date of these Directions.

Process of registration in e-Kuber system \nFirstly, a bank needs to register under the DEA Fund module on e-Kuber system. Secondly, a \nbank shall share two e-mail ids with dea.fund@rbi.org.in to complete the registration process. \nA bank (non-member bank), which does not have access to e-Kuber system is required to \nprovide two e-mail ids to its sponsor bank to complete the registration process. On completion \nof registration process, further communication from Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will be sent \nonly to the two e-mail ids registered in e-Kuber system. The aforesaid registration process is a \npre-requisite for a bank to remit the unclaimed amounts due and submit refund claims, as \ndefined in DEA Fund Scheme (the Scheme), in electronic form through e-Kuber system. A \nbank, which is yet to complete the registration process shall arrange to complete it \nexpeditiously. \n \n2. Authorised signatories of a bank \nA bank shall identify officers (authorised signatories) to operate the bank\u2019s DEA Fund account \njointly, who shall be responsible for authorising the applicable returns (Form-I, Form-II and \nRectification Forms as hereinafter detailed in the circular) under the DEA Fund Scheme. It \nshall submit to RBI, a certified true copy of the Resolution/Decision/Authorisation (in Hindi or \nEnglish only) provided by the Board of Directors/MD&CEO/ED/Committee of Executives \nempowered for the purpose along with the list of authorised signatories i.e., officials designated \nas authorised signatories (with a maximum of ten signatories), for the above purpose. Any \nupdates in the authorised officials shall be furnished in the prescribed revised format (Annex \nII), which would include details of both Resolution/ Decision/ Authorisation and specimen \nsignatures of all the authorised signatories. A bank, while communicating the changes made, \nshall ensure to submit details of all such authorised signatories and their specimen signatures \nto RBI, instead of furnishing only the additions or deletions made.  \n \n3. Procedure for transferring the unclaimed amount to the Fund  \n3.1 A bank shall transfer to the DEA Fund (the Fund), the amounts becoming due in each \ncalendar month (i.e., proceeds of the inoperative accounts and balances remaining unclaimed \nfor 10 years or more) as specified in the Scheme, and the interest accrued on interest bearing \naccounts till the date of transfer, during the last five working days of the subsequent month. \nBefore transferring the amount due to the Fund, the bank shall ensure that all legal obligations \nrelating to the same, till that date, including those pertaining to taxes deductible and payable, \nare met or adequate arrangements are made therefor. \n \n3 \n \n \n \n3.2 Own account - A member bank shall transfer to the Fund, the entire amount due through \ne-Kuber system under the module \u201cDEA Fund Services\u201d. When a member bank is crediting \namount due to the Fund, it shall furnish its DEA Fund Code in the \u201cBank DEA Fund Code\u201d field \nand the detailed breakup (number of accounts and amount) of the deposits, viz., interest \nbearing deposits, non-interest bearing deposits and other credits, which  also includes non-\ninterest bearing amount (i.e., any amount other than deposits remaining unclaimed as defined \nin paragraph 3(iii) of the Scheme), in the fields provided for the same in the e-Kuber system.  \n \n3.3 Other bank\u2019s (non-member) account - In case, a sponsor bank is remitting the amounts \ndue of other non-member banks, it shall not consolidate but separately remit the amount bank-\nwise to the Fund, by indicating appropriate Bank DEA Fund Code of the other (non-member) \nbank in the field provided in the e-Kuber. They should also provide the detailed break-up \n(number of accounts and amount) of the deposits, viz., interest-bearing deposits, non-interest \nbearing deposits and other credits in the respective fields, i.e., the fields designated for the \nsame, in the e-Kuber system.  \n \n4. Window for transferring unclaimed amount and submission of claim \n4.1 Deposit Window for transferring unclaimed amount \nThe window for transferring unclaimed amounts/deposits to the Fund through e-Kuber shall be \nkept open only during the last five working days of every month, and a bank (including the non-\nmember bank) is permitted to effect only one transfer of unclaimed amounts per month. A non-\nmember bank is advised to transfer the unclaimed amounts/deposits to its sponsor bank \n(through normal banking channel), sufficiently in advance of the due date, to enable the sponsor \nbank to transfer the same to the Fund through e-Kuber system. On receipt of the amount \ntransferred to the Fund, an auto generated acknowledgement receipt will be directly sent from \ne-Kuber system to the registered e-mail ids of the bank.  \n \n4.2 Claim Window for submission of claim \nThe window for submitting claim from the Fund shall be kept open in e-Kuber system during \nthe first 10 working days of every month. A bank shall submit only one consolidated claim per \nmonth. A non-member bank is advised to submit the claim to its sponsor bank sufficiently in \nadvance of the due date, to enable the sponsor bank to submit the same to RBI through e-\nKuber system. \n \n \n4 \n \n \n4.3 A bank is required to transfer the unclaimed amounts/deposits due to the Fund and submit \nthe claims, within the stipulated timeframe. It should also ensure correctness of the amount \ntransferred to/claimed from the Fund.  \n \n5. Procedure for submitting claim refund - Form II \n5.1 In terms of paragraph 4 (i) of the Scheme, in case of demand from a customer/depositor, \nwhose unclaimed amount/deposit had been transferred to Fund, a bank shall repay the \ncustomer/depositor, along with interest, if applicable, and thereafter, lodge a claim for refund \nfrom the Fund for an equivalent amount paid to the customer/depositor. In case of any claim \nmade by the customer/depositor for refund of only part amount, the bank shall repay the \ncustomer accordingly by making the account operative and keep the remaining amount \n(including the interest, if any) in the account, and thereafter lodge a claim for the entire amount \nfrom the Fund. Banks may refer to RBI\u2019s circular DOR.SOG (LEG).REC/64/09.08.024/2023-24 \ndated January 1, 2024 on Inoperative Accounts/Unclaimed Deposits in Banks - Revised \nInstructions, wherein operational guidelines on activation of inoperative accounts have been \nissued.  \n \n5.2 On submission of claim, an auto generated Form II (Annex IV) from the e-Kuber system \nwill be sent to the registered e-mail ids of the banks/non-member banks. A bank/non-member \nbank shall submit a printout of the auto generated Form II signed by the authorised officials \nand certified by the bank\u2019s auditors (internal/concurrent) to RBI, by e-mail and/or by post, within \nthree working days of its submission on the e-Kuber system. The bank/non-member bank shall \nalso submit a copy of the latest half-year Form III (Reconciliation Certificate-Annex V) and \nAnnual Certificate (Annex VI), while submitting the first claim during the half-year / year, as the \ncase may be, along with the claim form - Form II, else it will result in non-consideration of claim \nof the bank.  \n  \n5.3 The claim will be examined by RBI. If the claim is in order, the claimed amount will be \ncredited to the account of the member bank (with the sponsor bank in case of a non-member \nbank) maintained with RBI by the end of the same month. The claim settlement/rejection advice \nwill be sent to the respective bank on their registered e-mail ids. While making payment towards \nclaims from the Fund to a non-member bank, the RBI will credit the account of the sponsor \nbank.

In terms of \nparagraph II (9) of the aforesaid Licensing Guidelines, a small finance bank (SFB) is \nrequired to extend 75 per cent of its Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) to the sectors \neligible for classification as priority sector lending (PSL) by the Reserve Bank. Further, \nwhile 40 per cent of its ANBC should be allocated to different sub-sectors under PSL \nas per the extant PSL prescriptions, the bank can allocate the balance 35 per cent to \nany one or more sub-sectors under the PSL where it has competitive advantage. \n \nRevised provisions \n \n2. On a review, it has been decided that financial year 2025-26 onwards, the additional \ncomponent (35 per cent) of PSL shall be reduced to 20 per cent, thereby making the \noverall PSL target as 60 per cent of ANBC or Credit Equivalent of Off-Balance Sheet \nExposures (CEOBE), whichever is higher. The SFB shall continue to allocate 40 per \ncent of its ANBC or CEOBE, whichever is higher, to different sub-sectors under PSL \nas per the extant PSL prescriptions, while the balance 20 per cent shall be allocated \nto any one or more sub-sectors under the PSL where the bank has competitive \nadvantage. \n \n3. These instructions are issued in exercise of the powers conferred on the Reserve \nBank of India under Section 22 (1) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.  \nYours faithfully,  \n \n \n \n(Manoranjan Padhy)  \nChief General Manager \n",

The \nPrudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets issued on June 7, 2019, as \nupdated from time to time, (\u2018Prudential Framework\u2019) provides a comprehensive \nframework for early recognition and resolution of stress in borrower accounts. \nHowever, restructuring of exposures relating to projects under implementation on \naccount of change in date of commencement of commercial operations (DCCO) was \nexcluded from the ambit of the Prudential Framework, pending further review. \nBased on a comprehensive review of the regulatory norms and taking into account the \nexperience of banks with regard to financing of project loans, it has been decided to \nrationalise the extant guidelines and harmonise the same for all regulated entities \n(REs) which undertake project finance.  \nII. \nPreliminary  \n \nA. Preamble \n \n1. These Directions are issued to provide a harmonised framework for financing of \nprojects in infrastructure and non-infrastructure (including commercial real estate \n& commercial real estate- residential housing) sectors by REs. These Directions \nalso lay down the revised regulatory treatment upon change in the DCCO of such \nprojects in the backdrop of a review of the extant instructions and analysis of the \nrisks inherent in such financing.  \nB. Powers Exercised \n \n2. In exercise of the powers conferred by Sections 21 and 35A of Banking Regulation \nAct, 1949 read with Section 56 of the Act ibid; Chapter IIIB of the Reserve Bank of \nIndia Act, 1934; Section 30A of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987, read with \nSection 32 and Section 33 of the Act ibid; the Reserve Bank of India (hereinafter \ncalled the Reserve Bank), being satisfied that it is necessary and expedient in \npublic interest to do so, hereby, issues these Directions hereinafter specified. \n \n \n3 \n \nC.

Phases of Projects \n11. For the purpose of application of prudential guidelines contained in these \nDirections, Projects shall be broadly divided into three phases namely:  \n(a) Design phase \u2013 This is the first phase which starts with the genesis of the \nproject and includes, inter-alia, designing, planning, obtaining all applicable \nclearances/approvals till its financial closure. \n(b) Construction phase \u2013 This is the second phase which begins after the \nfinancial closure and ends on the day before the actual DCCO. \n(c) Operational Phase \u2013This is the last phase which starts with commencement \nof commercial operation by the project on the day of the actual DCCO and \nends with full repayment of the project finance exposure. \nH. Prudential Conditions Related to Sanction  \n12. The credit policies of a lender shall incorporate suitable clauses for sanction of \nproject finance exposures, taking into account inter alia the provisions under these \nDirections.  \n13. For all projects financed by a lender, it shall be ensured that: \n(a) Financial closure has been achieved and original DCCO is clearly spelt out \nand documented prior to disbursement of funds.  \n(b) The project specific disbursement schedule vis-\u00e0-vis stage of completion of \nthe project is included in the loan agreement.  \n(c) The post DCCO repayment schedule has been realistically designed to \nfactor in the initial cash flows.  \n \n8 \n \nProvided that, the original or revised repayment tenor, including the \nmoratorium period, if any, shall not exceed 85% of the economic life of \na project. \n14. For a given project, original/extended/actual DCCO, as the case may be, shall be \nsame across all lenders to the project.  \n15. In under-construction projects where the aggregate exposure of the lenders is up \nto \u20b91,500 crores, no individual lender shall have an exposure which is less than \n10% of the aggregate exposure. For projects where aggregate exposure of all \nlenders is more than \u20b91,500 crores, the exposure floor for an individual lender shall \nbe 5% or \u20b9150 crores, whichever is higher.  \nProvided that, the above minimum exposure requirements shall not apply post-\nactual DCCO and lenders may freely acquire from or sell exposures to other \nlenders, in compliance with guidelines contained in the Master Direction on \nTransfer of Loan Exposures as updated from time to time. Prior to actual DCCO, \nlenders may acquire from or sell exposures to other lenders under a syndication \narrangement4, provided the share of individual lenders is in adherence to the above \nlimits.  \n16.  A \nlender \nshall \nensure \nthat \nall \napplicable \napprovals/clearances \nfor \nimplementing/constructing the project are obtained before financial closure. An \nindicative list of such pre-requisite approvals/clearances includes environmental \nclearance, legal clearance, regulatory clearances, etc., as applicable to the project.  \n \n17. Approvals/clearances which are contingent upon achievement of certain \nmilestones in terms of project completion would be deemed to be applicable only \nwhen such milestones are achieved. For example, consent to operate a boiler can \nonly be applied for after the construction of a boiler. Hence, the same would not be \ntreated as an applicable mandatory pre-requisite at the time of financial closure. \n \n   \n                                                          \n \n4 As specified under Master Direction on Transfer of Loan Exposures as updated from time to time \n \n9 \n \nI. Prudential Conditions Related to Disbursement and Monitoring \n \n18. A lender shall ensure availability of sufficient land/right of way for all projects before \ndisbursement of funds, subject to the following minimum requirements: \n(a) For infrastructure projects under PPP model \u2013 50%   \n(b) For all other projects (non-PPP infrastructure, and non-infrastructure \nincluding CRE & CRE-RH) \u2013 75%  \n(c) For transmission line projects \u2013 as decided by a lender \n19. In case of infrastructure projects under PPP model, disbursement of funds shall \nbegin only after declaration of the Appointed date or its equivalent, for the project. \nHowever, in cases where non-fund based credit facilities may be mandated by the \nconcession granting authority as a pre-requisite for declaration of appointed date,  \na lender may sanction such credit facilities, in adherence with the extant regulatory \ninstructions on non-fund based facilities.  \n20. Further, in respect of the exposures mentioned at paragraph 19 above, the original \nDCCO documented in the financial closure document may be modified to reflect \nany change in the \u2018Appointed Date\u2019 by the Concession granting authority prior to \ndisbursement of funds by way of a supplementary agreement between a lender \nand the debtor subject to reassessment of project viability and obtention of sanction \nfrom appropriate authorities. A Techno-Economic Viability (TEV) study shall be \nrequired for this purpose for all projects where the aggregate exposure of all \nlenders is \u20b9100 crores or more. \n21. A lender shall ensure that disbursal is proportionate to the stages of completion of \nthe project as also to the progress in equity infusion and other sources of finance, \nagreed as part of financial closure and receipt of remaining applicable clearances. \nThe lender\u2019s Independent Engineer (LIE)/Architect shall certify the stages of \ncompletion of the project.  \n22. A project finance account may be classified as NPA during any time before actual \nDCCO as per record of recovery, in terms of  Master Circular - Prudential norms \non Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to \nAdvances dated April 01, 2025, as updated from time to time or the relevant \ninstructions as applicable to specific category of lenders. \n \n10 \n \nIV. \nPrudential Norms for Resolution  \n \nJ. Resolution of Stress \n23. A lender shall monitor the performance of the project and any buildup of stress on \nan ongoing basis and shall be expected to initiate a resolution plan well in advance. \nOccurrence of a credit event with any of the lenders during the construction phase, \nshall trigger a collective resolution in terms of the Prudential Framework5. The \nreference to \u2018default\u2019 in the Prudential Framework shall be read as \u2018credit event\u2019 for \nthe purpose of project finance accounts, unless specified otherwise.  \n24. Any such credit event shall be reported to the Central Repository of Information on \nLarge Credit (CRILC) by the lender in the prescribed weekly as well as the CRILC-\nMain report in compliance with the extant instructions, as applicable. A lender in a \nconsortium/multiple lending arrangement shall also report occurrence of such \ncredit event to all other members of the consortium/multiple lending arrangement. \nThe instructions on CRILC reporting shall be issued in due course. \n25. A lender shall undertake a prima facie review of the debtor account within thirty \ndays from the date of such credit event (\u201cReview Period\u201d). The conduct of the \nlender(s) during this Review Period, including signing of Inter Creditor Agreement \n(ICA), and the decision to implement a resolution plan, wherever required, shall be \nguided by the provisions of the Prudential Framework5, unless specified otherwise \nin these Directions.  \nK. Resolution Plans Involving Extension of Original / Extended DCCO \n \n26. A project finance account classified as standard and that satisfies all relevant \nprudential conditions specified in Chapter III of these Directions, where a resolution \nplan involving extension of original/ extended DCCO, as the case maybe, is \nimplemented, shall continue to be classified as \u2018Standard\u2019, provided the envisaged \nresolution plan ab initio conforms to the conditions stipulated hereunder: \n                                                          \n \n5 While the Prudential Framework is otherwise not applicable to certain categories of Lender(s) to which these \nDirections are addressed, all the norms applicable to implementation of a resolution plan, and specific \nimplementation conditions, as laid out in the Prudential Framework shall be applicable to all Lender(s) for any \nresolution plan implemented under this facility. \n \n11 \n \n(a) Permitted DCCO Deferment \u2013 Original / extended DCCO, as the case may \nbe, is extended, along with the consequential shift in repayment schedule \nfor equal or shorter duration (including the start date and end date of revised \nrepayment schedule), within the following time limits: \n \nInfrastructure \nProjects \nNon-Infrastructure Projects \n(including CRE and CRE-RH6) \nPermitted deferment of DCCO \nfrom the original DCCO  \nUpto 3 years  \nUpto 2 years  \n \n(b) Cost Overrun \u2013 A lender may finance, as part of a resolution plan, cost \noverrun associated with permitted DCCO deferment in compliance with \nparagraph 26(a) above, and classify the account as \u2018Standard\u2019, as under: \n(i) Cost overrun up to a maximum of 10% of the original project cost, in \naddition to IDC. \n(ii) Cost overrun is financed through SBCF specifically sanctioned by the \nlender at the time of financial closure7.  \n(iii) For infrastructure projects,  in cases where SBCF was not sanctioned at \nthe time of financial closure, or was sanctioned but not renewed \nsubsequently, such additional funding shall be priced at a premium to \nwhat would have been applicable on a pre-sanctioned SBCF. Lenders \nshall ensure that the loan-contracts ab-initio specify the additional risk \npremium to be charged on such SBCF, which may be revised upwards \nbased on actual risk assessment at the time of sanction of such facilities.  \n(iv) The financial parameters like D/E ratio, external credit rating8  (if any) \netc. remain unchanged or are enhanced in favour of the lender post such \ncost overrun funding. \n                                                          \n \n6 For CRE and CRE-RH projects, all provisions of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (as \nupdated from time to time) are to be complied with. \n7 The facility has been sanctioned at the time of financial closure and has been renewed continuously without \nany gap till the draw down under the facility. \n8 For projects where aggregate exposure of all lenders is less than \u20b9100 crore, internal credit rating may be \nconsidered, provided the project was originally not credit rated externally. \n \n12 \n \n(c) Change in Scope and Size \u2013 A project finance account where DCCO \nextension is necessitated by an increase in the project outlay on account of \nincrease in scope and size of the project, may be classified as \u2018Standard\u2019, \nsubject to complying with the following conditions: \n(i) The rise in project cost excluding any cost-overrun in respect of the \noriginal project is 25% or more of the original outlay as the case may \nbe (Illustration given in Annex 1). \n(ii) A lender re-assesses the viability of the project before approving the \nenhancement of scope and fixing a fresh DCCO. \n(iii) On re-rating (if already rated), the new external credit rating is not \nbelow the previous external credit rating by more than one notch.  \nIf the project debt was unrated at the time of increase in scope or \nsize, then it should be externally rated investment grade upon such \nincrease in scope or size in case of projects where aggregate \nexposure of all lenders is equal to or greater than \u20b9100 crores. \nThe standard asset classification benefit on account of \u2018change in scope\u2019 \nshall be allowed only once during the lifetime of the project.  \n27. Further, in all the above cases, the following conditions shall be required to be met \nbefore the expiry of 180 days from the end of the Review Period, for successful \nimplementation of a resolution plan: \ni. all required documentation, including execution of necessary agreements \nbetween a lender and the debtor/ creation of security charge/ perfection of \nsecurities, are completed in consonance with the resolution plan being \nimplemented. \nii. the new capital structure and/ or changes in the financing agreement get duly \nreflected in the books of a lender and the debtor. \n28. If the resolution plan involving change in DCCO is not successfully implemented in \nterms of paragraph 26 and/or 27 above, then the account shall be downgraded to \nNPA immediately. \n \n13 \n \nL. Criteria for Upgradation \n  \n29. A project finance account downgraded to NPA for non-compliance with paragraph \n26 above, can be upgraded only after the account performs satisfactorily9 post \nactual DCCO.  \n30. A project finance account downgraded to NPA for non-compliance with paragraph \n27 above, can be upgraded on successful implementation of resolution plan, \nprovided no further request for DCCO deferment is received.  \nM. Income Recognition  \n31. A lender may recognise income on accrual basis in respect of project finance \nexposures which are classified as \u2018Standard\u2019. For NPAs, income recognition shall \nbe as per extant instructions contained in Master Circular - Prudential norms on \nIncome Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to Advances \ndated April 01, 2025, as updated from time to time or the relevant instructions as \napplicable to specific category of lenders. \nN. Provisioning for Standard Assets  \n32. For project finance exposures, a lender shall maintain a general provision at the \nfollowing rates for the funded outstanding on a portfolio basis: \n \nConstruction Phase \nOperational Phase \u2013 after \ncommencement of \nrepayment of interest and \nprincipal  \nCRE \n1.25% \n1.00% \nCRE-RH \n1.00% \n0.75% \nAll others \n1.00% \n0.40% \n \nO. Provisioning for DCCO Deferred Standard Assets \n33. For accounts which have availed DCCO deferment as per Part K of these \nDirections and are classified as \u2018standard\u2019, lenders shall maintain additional \nspecific provisions of 0.375% for infrastructure project loans and 0.5625% for non-\ninfrastructure project loans (including CRE and CRE-RH), for each quarter of \n                                                          \n \n9 Satisfactory performance as defined in Prudential Framework or the relevant instructions as applicable to \nspecific category of lenders where the Prudential Framework is not applicable. \n \n14 \n \ndeferment, over and above the applicable standard asset provision specified at \nparagraph 32 above (illustration given in Annex 2). These additional specific \nprovisions shall be reversed upon commencement of commercial operation.  \nP. Provisioning for Existing Projects  \n34. The provisions stipulated in paragraph 32 and 33 shall not be applicable for existing \nprojects which are specified under paragraph 7 of Part E of these Directions. Such \nproject loans shall continue to be guided by the existing prudential guidelines for \nthe purpose of provisioning, which otherwise shall be treated as repealed.  \n35. In case of any resolution of a fresh credit event and/or change in material terms \nand conditions in the loan contract in such projects, subsequent to the effective \ndate, the provisions stipulated at paragraph 32 and 33 shall apply to these projects \nas if these were sanctioned post the effective date.  \nQ.
