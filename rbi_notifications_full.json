However, Reserve Bank\u2019s supervisory reviews have indicated \ndivergent practices amongst Regulated Entities (REs) with regard to levy of pre-payment \ncharges in case of loans sanctioned to MSEs which lead to customer grievances and \ndisputes. Further, certain REs have been found to include restrictive clauses in loan \ncontracts/ agreements to deter borrowers from switching over to another lender, either \nfor availing lower rates of interest or better terms of service. Accordingly, as announced \nin the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies dated October 9, 2024, a \ndraft circular in this regard was issued on February 21, 2025 for public consultation. \n2. Based on a review of the supervisory findings and public feedback received on the \ndraft circular, the Reserve Bank, in exercise of the powers conferred by Sections 21, 35A \nand 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, Sections 45JA, 45L and 45M of the Reserve \nBank of India Act, 1934 and Section 30A of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987, hereby \nissues the Directions hereinafter specified.  \n \n3.(i) These Directions shall be called the Reserve Bank of India (Pre-payment Charges \non Loans) Directions, 2025. \n(ii) These Directions shall be applicable to all loans2 and advances sanctioned or \nrenewed on or after January 1, 2026.  \n \n                                                            \n1 As defined in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006 \n2 The term \u2018loans\u2019, for the purpose of this circular, shall include term loans as well as demand loans \n2 \n \n4. These Directions shall apply to all commercial banks (excluding payments banks), co-\noperative banks, NBFCs and All India Financial Institutions.  \n \n5. An RE shall adhere to the following Directions regarding levy of pre-payment charges \non all floating rate loans and advances: \n(i)  For all loans granted for purposes other than business to individuals, with or without \nco-obligant(s), an RE shall not levy pre-payment charges;  \n(ii) For all loans granted for business purpose to individuals and MSEs, with or without \nco-obligant(s):  \n(a) A commercial bank (excluding Small Finance bank, Regional Rural bank and \nLocal Area bank), a Tier 4 Primary (Urban) Co-operative bank, an NBFC-UL, and \nan All India Financial Institution shall not levy any pre-payment charges.  \n(b) A Small Finance bank, a Regional Rural bank, a Tier 3 Primary (Urban) Co-\noperative bank, State Cooperative bank, Central Cooperative bank and an NBFC-\nML shall not levy any pre-payment charges on loans with sanctioned amount/ limit \nup to \u20b950 lakh. \n(iii) The Directions at paragraphs 5(i) and 5(ii) above shall be applicable irrespective of \nthe source of funds used for pre-payment of loans, either in part or in full, and without any \nminimum lock-in period. \n(iv) Applicability of above Directions for dual/ special rate (combination of fixed and \nfloating rate) loans will depend on whether the loan is on floating rate at the time of pre-\npayment.  \n \n6. In cases other than those mentioned at paragraphs 5(i) and 5(ii) above, pre-payment \ncharges, if any, shall be as per the approved policy of the RE. However, in case of term \nloans, pre-payment charges, if levied by the RE, shall be based on the amount being \nprepaid. In case of cash credit/ overdraft facilities, pre-payment charges on closure of the \nfacility before the due date shall be levied on an amount not exceeding the sanctioned \nlimit. \n \n7. In case of cash credit/ overdraft facilities, no pre-payment charges shall be applicable \nif the borrower intimates the RE of his/ her/ its intention not to renew the facility before \nthe period as stipulated in the loan agreement, provided that the facility gets closed on \n3 \n \nthe due date. \n \n8. An RE shall not levy any charges where pre-payment is effected at the instance of the \nRE. \n \n9. The applicability or otherwise of pre-payment charges shall be clearly disclosed in the \nsanction letter and loan agreement. Further, in case of loans and advances where Key \nFacts Statement (KFS) is to be provided as specified in the Reserve Bank\u2019s circular dated \nApril 15, 2024 on \u2018Key Facts Statement for Loans and Advances\u2019, the same shall also be \nmentioned in the KFS. No pre-payment charges which have not been disclosed as \nspecified herein shall be charged by an RE. \n \n10. An RE shall not levy any charges/ fees retrospectively at the time of pre-payment of \nloans, which were waived off earlier by the RE. \n \n11. Repeal Provisions \nWith the issue of these Directions, the instructions contained in the circulars/ Master \nDirections mentioned in Annex, issued by the Reserve Bank, shall stand repealed from \nthe effective date of these Directions. All the repealed circulars shall be deemed to have \nbeen in force during the relevant periods, prior to the coming into effect of these \ninstructions.  \n \n(Veena Srivastava) \nChief General Manager \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \n  Annex \n \nList of circulars/ instructions in Master Directions repealed \nSr. \nNo. \nCircular No. \nDate \nSubject \n1. \nDBOD.No.Dir.BC.107/13.03.0\n0/2011-12 \nJune 5, 2012 \nHome Loans - Levy of Fore-\nclosure \nCharges/ \nPre-\npayment Penalty \n2. \nRPCD.CO.RCBD.BC.No.84/0\n3.03.01/2011-12 \nJune 15, 2012 \nHome Loans - Levy of Fore - \nClosure \nCharges/ \nPre-\npayment Penalty \n3. \nRPCD.CO.RRB.BC.No.85/03.\n05.033/2011-12 \nJune 18, 2012 \nHome Loans - Levy of Fore - \nClosure \nCharges/ \nPre-\npayment Penalty \n4. \nUBD.BPD.(PCB)CIR.No.41/12\n.05.001/2011-12 \nJune 26, 2012 \nHome Loans - Levy of Fore-\nclosure \nCharges/ \nPre-\npayment Penalty by Urban \nCo-operative Banks (UCBs) \n5. \nDBOD.Dir.BC.No.110/13.03.0\n0/2013-14 \nMay 7, 2014 \nLevy of Foreclosure Charges/ \nPre-payment \nPenalty \non \nFloating Rate Term Loans \n6. \nUBD.CO.BPD.PCB.Cir.No.64/\n12.05.001/2013-14 \nMay 26, 2014 \nLevy of Foreclosure Charges/ \nPre-payment \nPenalty \non \nFloating Rate Term Loans \n7. \nRPCD.CO.RCBD.RRB.BC.No.\n102/07.51.013/2013-14 \nMay 27, 2014 \nLevy of Foreclosure Charges/ \nPre-payment \nPenalty \non \nFloating Rate Term Loans \n8. \nDBR.Dir.BC.No.08/13.03.00/2\n019-20 \nAugust 2, 2019 Levy of Foreclosure Charges/ \nPre-payment \nPenalty \non \nFloating Rate Term Loans \n9. \nMaster \nDirection \n\u2013 \nNon-\nBanking Financial Company \u2013 \nHousing Finance Company \n(Reserve \nBank) \nDirections, \n2021 \nFebruary 17, \n2021 (as \namended from \ntime to time) \nParagraph 85.7 \n10.

Process of registration in e-Kuber system \nFirstly, a bank needs to register under the DEA Fund module on e-Kuber system. Secondly, a \nbank shall share two e-mail ids with dea.fund@rbi.org.in to complete the registration process. \nA bank (non-member bank), which does not have access to e-Kuber system is required to \nprovide two e-mail ids to its sponsor bank to complete the registration process. On completion \nof registration process, further communication from Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will be sent \nonly to the two e-mail ids registered in e-Kuber system. The aforesaid registration process is a \npre-requisite for a bank to remit the unclaimed amounts due and submit refund claims, as \ndefined in DEA Fund Scheme (the Scheme), in electronic form through e-Kuber system. A \nbank, which is yet to complete the registration process shall arrange to complete it \nexpeditiously. \n \n2. Authorised signatories of a bank \nA bank shall identify officers (authorised signatories) to operate the bank\u2019s DEA Fund account \njointly, who shall be responsible for authorising the applicable returns (Form-I, Form-II and \nRectification Forms as hereinafter detailed in the circular) under the DEA Fund Scheme.

Any \nupdates in the authorised officials shall be furnished in the prescribed revised format (Annex \nII), which would include details of both Resolution/ Decision/ Authorisation and specimen \nsignatures of all the authorised signatories. A bank, while communicating the changes made, \nshall ensure to submit details of all such authorised signatories and their specimen signatures \nto RBI, instead of furnishing only the additions or deletions made.  \n \n3. Procedure for transferring the unclaimed amount to the Fund  \n3.1 A bank shall transfer to the DEA Fund (the Fund), the amounts becoming due in each \ncalendar month (i.e., proceeds of the inoperative accounts and balances remaining unclaimed \nfor 10 years or more) as specified in the Scheme, and the interest accrued on interest bearing \naccounts till the date of transfer, during the last five working days of the subsequent month. \nBefore transferring the amount due to the Fund, the bank shall ensure that all legal obligations \nrelating to the same, till that date, including those pertaining to taxes deductible and payable, \nare met or adequate arrangements are made therefor. \n \n3 \n \n \n \n3.2 Own account - A member bank shall transfer to the Fund, the entire amount due through \ne-Kuber system under the module \u201cDEA Fund Services\u201d. When a member bank is crediting \namount due to the Fund, it shall furnish its DEA Fund Code in the \u201cBank DEA Fund Code\u201d field \nand the detailed breakup (number of accounts and amount) of the deposits, viz., interest \nbearing deposits, non-interest bearing deposits and other credits, which  also includes non-\ninterest bearing amount (i.e., any amount other than deposits remaining unclaimed as defined \nin paragraph 3(iii) of the Scheme), in the fields provided for the same in the e-Kuber system.  \n \n3.3 Other bank\u2019s (non-member) account - In case, a sponsor bank is remitting the amounts \ndue of other non-member banks, it shall not consolidate but separately remit the amount bank-\nwise to the Fund, by indicating appropriate Bank DEA Fund Code of the other (non-member) \nbank in the field provided in the e-Kuber. They should also provide the detailed break-up \n(number of accounts and amount) of the deposits, viz., interest-bearing deposits, non-interest \nbearing deposits and other credits in the respective fields, i.e., the fields designated for the \nsame, in the e-Kuber system.  \n \n4. Window for transferring unclaimed amount and submission of claim \n4.1 Deposit Window for transferring unclaimed amount \nThe window for transferring unclaimed amounts/deposits to the Fund through e-Kuber shall be \nkept open only during the last five working days of every month, and a bank (including the non-\nmember bank) is permitted to effect only one transfer of unclaimed amounts per month. A non-\nmember bank is advised to transfer the unclaimed amounts/deposits to its sponsor bank \n(through normal banking channel), sufficiently in advance of the due date, to enable the sponsor \nbank to transfer the same to the Fund through e-Kuber system. On receipt of the amount \ntransferred to the Fund, an auto generated acknowledgement receipt will be directly sent from \ne-Kuber system to the registered e-mail ids of the bank.  \n \n4.2 Claim Window for submission of claim \nThe window for submitting claim from the Fund shall be kept open in e-Kuber system during \nthe first 10 working days of every month. A bank shall submit only one consolidated claim per \nmonth. A non-member bank is advised to submit the claim to its sponsor bank sufficiently in \nadvance of the due date, to enable the sponsor bank to submit the same to RBI through e-\nKuber system. \n \n \n4 \n \n \n4.3 A bank is required to transfer the unclaimed amounts/deposits due to the Fund and submit \nthe claims, within the stipulated timeframe. It should also ensure correctness of the amount \ntransferred to/claimed from the Fund.  \n \n5. Procedure for submitting claim refund - Form II \n5.1 In terms of paragraph 4 (i) of the Scheme, in case of demand from a customer/depositor, \nwhose unclaimed amount/deposit had been transferred to Fund, a bank shall repay the \ncustomer/depositor, along with interest, if applicable, and thereafter, lodge a claim for refund \nfrom the Fund for an equivalent amount paid to the customer/depositor. In case of any claim \nmade by the customer/depositor for refund of only part amount, the bank shall repay the \ncustomer accordingly by making the account operative and keep the remaining amount \n(including the interest, if any) in the account, and thereafter lodge a claim for the entire amount \nfrom the Fund. Banks may refer to RBI\u2019s circular DOR.SOG (LEG).REC/64/09.08.024/2023-24 \ndated January 1, 2024 on Inoperative Accounts/Unclaimed Deposits in Banks - Revised \nInstructions, wherein operational guidelines on activation of inoperative accounts have been \nissued.  \n \n5.2 On submission of claim, an auto generated Form II (Annex IV) from the e-Kuber system \nwill be sent to the registered e-mail ids of the banks/non-member banks.

The bank/non-member bank shall \nalso submit a copy of the latest half-year Form III (Reconciliation Certificate-Annex V) and \nAnnual Certificate (Annex VI), while submitting the first claim during the half-year / year, as the \ncase may be, along with the claim form - Form II, else it will result in non-consideration of claim \nof the bank.  \n  \n5.3 The claim will be examined by RBI. If the claim is in order, the claimed amount will be \ncredited to the account of the member bank (with the sponsor bank in case of a non-member \nbank) maintained with RBI by the end of the same month. The claim settlement/rejection advice \nwill be sent to the respective bank on their registered e-mail ids. While making payment towards \nclaims from the Fund to a non-member bank, the RBI will credit the account of the sponsor \nbank. The sponsor bank is required to credit the same to the non-member bank. \n \n5.4 The claims will be processed by the RBI based on the information provided by a bank in \nForm II. Therefore, the onus of making correct refund claims from the Fund will solely lie with \nthe bank.  \n \n5 \n \n \n \n5.5 A bank is not required to provide the customer-wise details in case of refund claims in Form \nII. It should, however, maintain the customer-wise details of claims at its end, duly certified by \nits bank\u2019s auditors (internal/concurrent), which RBI may seek at a later stage/during the \nsupervisory review process. \n \n5.6 Proper due diligence as required under RBI\u2019s Master Direction - Know Your Customer \n(KYC) Direction, 2016 (as amended from time to time) should also be carried out before making \npayments to customers. A bank should verify the genuineness of the claims while making the \nprocess smoother and hassle free for the customers. \n \n5.7 Interest payable on unclaimed interest bearing deposit - The rate of interest, if any, \npayable (by a bank to its depositors/claimants) on the principal amount of unclaimed interest-\nbearing deposit amount transferred to the Fund, shall be specified by the Reserve Bank of India \nfrom time to time, as envisaged in the paragraph 4 (iii) of the Scheme.

Submission of Returns \nThe following returns have been prescribed to the banks in terms of paragraph 5 of the Scheme. \n \n6.1 Form I - Monthly Statement  \n6.1.1 At the end of every month, the e-Kuber system will auto generate a Form I (Annex III) \nfor each bank (including non-member banks) and send it to their registered e-mail ids, including \nthose banks which have not transferred any deposits. A bank (or sponsor bank on behalf of its \nnon-member bank), after verifying the correctness of Form I, is required to submit the same \nonline to RBI through e-Kuber system.  \n \n6.1.2 The auto generated Form I is confirmed only if the bank (sponsor bank in case of non-\nmember bank) agrees with the balances shown in Form I by ticking the two check-boxes on \nthe screen of e-Kuber system a) \u201cI Agree\u201d and b) \u201cForm has been duly audited by bank\u2019s \nauditors (internal/concurrent)\u201d.
