At present, all transactions in OTC markets for Rupee interest rate derivatives, \nforward contracts in Government securities, foreign currency derivatives, foreign \ncurrency interest rate derivatives, and credit derivatives are reported to the Trade \nRepository managed by Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL-TR). It has now \nbeen decided to mandate UTI for all such transactions. A framework for the \nimplementation of UTI for OTC derivative transactions, is enclosed at Annex.  \n3. The directions shall come into effect from January 01, 2027 and shall be applicable \nto OTC derivative transactions entered into on or after the date the directions come \ninto effect.  \n4. These directions have been issued in exercise of the powers conferred under \nsection 45W of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 read with section 45U of the Act \nand of all the powers enabling it in this behalf. \nYours faithfully, \n \n(Dimple Bhandia) \nChief General Manager\n1 \n \n(Annex to circular CO.FMRD.MIOD.No.8/11.01.057/2025-26 dated February 18, \n2026 on Unique Transaction Identifier for OTC Derivative Transactions) \n \n1. \nThe directions shall be applicable to all OTC derivative transactions undertaken \nin terms of the following directions (hereinafter \u201cGoverning Directions\u201d): \na. Foreign Exchange Management (Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts) \nRegulations, 2000 (Notification no. FEMA.25/RB-2000 dated May 3, 2000) and \nMaster Direction \u2013 Risk Management and Inter-Bank Dealings (Notification no. \nFMRD Master Direction No. 1/2016-17 dated July 05, 2016), as amended from \ntime to time. \nb.

Any other Direction(s), as may be specified by the Reserve Bank. \n2. \n Unique Transaction Identifier (UTI), a unique identifier assigned to an OTC \nderivative transaction, shall be generated / reported for all transactions in OTC \nderivatives market undertaken in terms of the Governing Directions. The directions \nshall be applicable to OTC derivative transactions entered into on or after the date the \ndirections come into effect. \n3. \n UTI shall be generated in accordance with the UTI Technical Guidance issued \nby the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) - International \nOrganisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) in February 2017. It shall have a \nmaximum of 52 characters comprising the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) of the generating \nentity followed by a unique identifier and shall be unique to a derivative transaction \nthroughout its lifecycle.  \n2 \n \n4.  \nThe UTI generating entity shall be determined as per the waterfall in Table 1 \nwith the responsibility of UTI generation assigned to the next entity in the waterfall in \ncase the identified UTI generating entity is unable or unwilling to generate the UTI.  In \nterms of the waterfall, if a transaction is reported to the Clearing Corporation of India \nLimited \u2013 Trade Repository (CCIL-TR) without the UTI, the CCIL-TR shall generate \nthe UTI for the transaction. \nTable 1: Generation of UTI \nTransactions reportable only in India \nTransactions reportable in India and \none or more foreign jurisdictions \n1) The CCP, if the CCP is counterparty \nto the transaction.  \n1) The \nCCP, \nif \nthe \nCCP \nis \ncounterparty to the transaction.  \n2) The ETP, if the transaction is \nexecuted on an ETP. \n \n2) Clearing Member, if a Clearing \nMember is counterparty to the \ntransaction.  \n3) An entity as is mutually agreed \nbetween the counterparties. \n3) ETP, if the transaction is executed \non an ETP.  \n4) CCIL-TR. \nA. If a foreign jurisdiction has a \nsooner reporting timeline1 \n4) An entity as per the requirements in \nthe foreign jurisdiction. \nB. If the foreign jurisdiction does not \nhave sooner reporting timeline \n4) An entity as is mutually agreed \nbetween the counterparties.  \n5) CCIL-TR. \n5. \nFor transactions that are reportable in India and in a foreign jurisdiction and the \nforeign jurisdiction has a sooner reporting timeline, market participants may undertake \nreasonable efforts to ensure that the UTI is obtained and reported within the reporting \ndeadline for the transaction. In case the market participant is unable to obtain the UTI \nwithin the reporting deadline, the market participant may obtain and submit the UTI to \nCCIL-TR at the earliest thereafter, but in any case, within five Mumbai business days \nfrom the date of the transaction. Any temporary UTI reported by the market participant \n \n1 The jurisdiction with the sooner reporting deadline will be identified as per the order of UTI Regulatory \nReporting Deadlines identified in the FAQs (CDIDE/2024/77) dated October 28, 2024 published by the \nRegulatory Oversight Committee (ROC). \n3 \n \nor generated by the CCIL-TR when the transaction was initially reported, will then be \ntreated as an interim UTI. \n6. \nAmendments to a derivative contract, post reporting to the CCIL-TR, shall not \nnecessitate the generation of a new UTI. However, a lifecycle event such as novation \nthat results in the creation of a new reportable derivative contract, as per extant \nreporting guidelines, shall necessitate the generation of a new UTI. \n7.  \nCCIL shall issue the operating guidelines and reporting formats for reporting of \nUTI.  \n8. \nMarket participants shall ensure that necessary arrangements are put in place \nfor ensuring compliance with these directions.  \n \n  \n-X-X-X \n \n \n \n",
