The above amendment shall come into force with immediate effect. \nYours faithfully, \n \n(Nisha Nambiar) \nChief General Manager-in-Charge \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n \n   Annex IIIA \n\u201cPriority Sector Lending Certificates - Scheme \ni) Purpose: To enable banks to achieve the priority sector lending target and \nsub-targets by purchase of these instruments in the event of shortfall and at the \nsame time incentivize the surplus banks; thereby enhancing lending to the \ncategories under priority sector. \nii) Nature of the Instruments: The seller will be selling fulfilment of priority sector \nobligation and the buyer would be buying the same. There will be no transfer of \nrisks or loan assets. \niii) Modalities: The PSLCs will be traded through the CBS portal (e-Kuber) of \nRBI. The detailed operational instructions for carrying out the trades are \navailable through the e-Kuber portal. \niv) Sellers/Buyers: Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs), Regional Rural \nBanks (RRBs), Local Area Banks (LABs), Small Finance Banks (SFBs) and \nUrban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) who have originated PSL eligible category \nloans subject to such regulations as may be issued by the Bank. \nv) Types of PSLCs: There would be four kinds of PSLCs :\u2013 \ni) PSLC Agriculture: Counting for achievement towards the total agriculture \nlending target. \nii) PSLC SF/MF: Counting for achievement towards the sub-target for lending \nto Small and Marginal Farmers. \niii) PSLC Micro Enterprises: Counting for achievement towards the sub target \nfor lending to Micro Enterprises. \niv) PSLC General: Counting for achievement towards the overall priority sector \ntarget. \nAs stated in the Master Directions - Reserve Bank of India (Priority Sector \nLending \u2013 Targets and Classification) Directions, 2025, Priority Sector \ncomprises several categories, including Agriculture and Micro Enterprises. In \naddition to the overall target and sectoral targets for lending to agriculture and \n \n12 \n \nmicro enterprises, banks are required to achieve specified sub-target for \nlending to Small and Marginal Farmers. Accordingly, to avoid computational \nissues in assessing the achievement/shortfall of PSL targets, it is advised that \nthe above four types of certificates will represent specific loans and count for \nspecific sub-targets/targets as indicated hereunder: \nS. \nNo. \nType of PSLCs \nRepresenting \nCounting for \n1. PSLC \n- \nAgriculture \nAll eligible Agriculture \nloans except loans to \nSF/MF \nfor \nwhich \nseparate \ncertificates \nare available \nAchievement \nof \nagriculture \ntarget and overall PSL target \n2. PSLC - SF/MF \nAll eligible loans to \nsmall/marginal farmers \nAchievement of SF/MF sub-\ntarget, Weaker Sections sub-\ntarget, \nNCF \nsub-target, \nagriculture target and overall \nPSL target \n3. PSLC \n- \nMicro \nEnterprises \nAll PSL Loans to Micro \nEnterprises \nAchievement \nof \nmicro-\nenterprise \nsub-target \nand \noverall PSL target \n4. PSLC - General The residual priority \nsector loans i.e. other \nthan \nloans \nto \nagriculture and micro \nenterprises for which \nseparate \ncertificates \nare available \nAchievement of overall PSL \ntarget \n \nThus, a bank having shortfall in achievement of any sub-target (e.g. SF/MF, \nMicro), will have to buy the specific PSLC to achieve the target. However, if a \nbank is having shortfall in achievement of the overall target only, as applicable \nto it, may buy any of the available PSLCs. \n \n13 \n \nvi) Computation of PSL achievement: A bank\u2019s PSL achievement would be \ncomputed as the sum of outstanding priority sector loans, and the net nominal \nvalue of the PSLCs issued and purchased. Such computation will be done \nseparately where sub targets are prescribed as on the reporting date. \nvii) Amount eligible for issue: Normally PSLCs will be issued against the \nunderlying assets. However, with the objective of developing a strong and \nvibrant market for PSLCs, a bank is permitted to issue PSLCs upto 50 percent \nof previous year\u2019s PSL achievement without having the underlying in its books. \nHowever, as on the reporting date, the bank must have met the priority sector \ntarget by way of the sum of outstanding priority sector lending portfolio and net \nof PSLCs issued and purchased. To the extent of shortfall in the achievement \nof target, banks may be required to invest in RIDF/other funds as hitherto. \nviii) Credit Risk: There will be no transfer of credit risk on the underlying as there \nis no transfer of tangible assets or cash flow. \nix) Expiry date: All PSLCs will expire by March 31st and will not be valid beyond \nthe reporting date (March 31st), irrespective of the date it was first sold. \nx) Settlement: The settlement of funds will be done through the platform as \nexplained in the e-Kuber portal. \nxi) Value and Fee: The nominal value of PSLC would represent the equivalent \nof the PSL that would get deducted from the PSL portfolio of the seller and \nadded to the PSL portfolio of the buyer. The buyer would pay a fee to the seller \nwhich will be market determined. \nxii) Lot Size: The PSLCs would have a standard lot size of \u20b9 25 lakh and \nmultiples thereof. \nxiii) Accounting: The fee paid for purchase of the PSLC would be treated as an \n\u2018Expense\u2019 and the fee received for the sale of PSLCs would be treated as \n\u2018Miscellaneous Income\u2019. \nxiv) Disclosures: Both seller and buyer shall report the amount of PSLCs \n(category-wise) sold and purchased during the year in the \u2018Disclosures to the \nBalance Sheet\u2019. \n \n14 \n \nIllustration: \n1. Bank A may sell PSLCs with a nominal value of \u20b9100 crores to Bank B on \nJuly 15, 2025. Bank B will reckon \u20b9100 crore towards its priority sector \nachievement as on the reporting dates of September 30, 2025, December 31, \n2025 & March 31, 2026, while Bank A will subtract the same from its \nachievement figures for the respective reporting dates. The PSLC will expire by \nMarch 31, 2026. \n2. Bank C may buy \u20b9100 crore PSLC on March 30, 2026 from Bank D. Bank D \nwill subtract \u20b9100 crore from its PSL reporting on March 31, 2026 while Bank C \nwill reckon the same towards its achievement. The PSLC will expire by March \n31, 2026.\u201d \n \n \n",

In this regard, it is advised that Government of India has approved the continuation of \nthe Modified Interest Subvention Scheme (MISS) for the financial year 2025-26 with the \nfollowing stipulations: \n(i) \nIn order to provide short term crop loans and short term loans for allied activities \nincluding animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries, bee keeping etc. upto an overall limit \nof \u20b93 lakh to farmers through KCC at concessional interest rate during the year \n2025-26, it has been decided to provide interest subvention to lending institutions \nviz. Public Sector Banks (PSBs) and Private Sector Banks (in respect of loans \ngiven by their rural and semi-urban branches only), Small Finance Banks (SFBs) \n\u092c\u0947\u091f\u0940 \u092c\u091a\u093e\u0913 \n\u092c\u0947\u091f\u0940 \u092a\u095d\u093e\u0913 \n2 \n \nand computerized Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies (PACS) ceded with \nScheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs), on use of their own resources. This \ninterest subvention will be calculated on the loan amount from the date of its \ndisbursement/drawal/renewal up to the date of actual repayment of the loan by \nthe farmer or up to the tenure/ due date/renewal of loans fixed by the \nbanks/PACS, whichever is earlier, subject to a maximum period of one year. The \napplicable lending rate to farmers and the rate of interest subvention for the \nfinancial year 2025-26 will be as follows: \n \nFinancial Year \nLending rate to \nfarmers \nRate of Interest Subvention \nto Lending Institutions \n2025-26 \n7% \n1.50% \n \n(ii) \nAn additional interest subvention of 3% per annum will be provided to such of \nthose farmers repaying in time, i.e., from the date of disbursement/drawl/renewal \nof the loan/s upto the actual date of repayment/tenure/due date or upto the due \ndate fixed by the banks for repayment of such loan/s, whichever is earlier, subject \nto a maximum period of one year from the date of disbursement. This also implies \nthat the farmers repaying promptly as above would get short term crop loans \nand/or short term loans for allied activities including animal husbandry, dairy, \nfisheries, bee keeping etc. @ 4% per annum during the financial year 2025-26. \nThis benefit would not accrue to those farmers who repay their agri loans after \none year of availing such loans. \n(iii) \nInterest subvention and prompt repayment incentive benefits on short term crop \nloans and short term loans for allied activities will be available on an overall limit \nof \u20b93 lakh per annum subject to a maximum sub-limit of \u20b92 lakh per farmer in \nrespect of those farmers involved only in activities related to animal husbandry, \ndairy, fisheries, bee keeping etc. The limit for crop loan component will take \npriority for interest subvention and prompt repayment incentive benefits and the \nresidual amount will be considered towards allied activities including animal \nhusbandry, dairy, fisheries, bee keeping etc. subject to the cap as mentioned \nabove. (Illustrations) \n3 \n \n(iv) \nIn order to discourage distress sale by farmers and to encourage them to store \ntheir produce in warehouses, the benefit of interest subvention under KCC will be \navailable to small and marginal farmers for a further period of upto six months \npost the harvest of the crop against negotiable warehouse receipts on the produce \nstored in warehouses accredited with Warehousing Development Regulatory \nAuthority (WDRA), at the same rate as applicable to the crop loan from the date \nof pledge. \n(v) \nTo provide relief to farmers affected by natural calamities, the applicable rate of \ninterest subvention for that year will be made available to banks for the first year \non the restructured loan amount. Such restructured loans will attract normal rate \nof interest from the second year onwards. \n(vi) \nHowever, to provide relief to farmers affected due to severe natural calamities, \nthe applicable rate of interest subvention for that year will be made available to \nbanks for first three years/entire period (subject to a maximum of five years) on \nthe restructured loan amount. Further, in all such cases, the benefit of prompt \nrepayment incentive @3% per annum shall also be provided to the affected \nfarmers. The grant of such benefit in cases of severe natural calamities shall, \nhowever, be decided by a High Level Committee (HLC) based on the \nrecommendations of the Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) and Sub \nCommittee of National Executive Committee (SC-NEC). \n3. Further, banks are advised to adhere to the following stipulations: \n(i) \nMandatory Aadhaar Authentication: Aadhaar seeding and authentication are \nmandatory for availing benefits under the scheme. All lending institutions must \nensure that e\u00adKYC is completed for every farmer to enable seamless access to \nscheme benefits. \n(ii) \nValidation of Multiple Accounts of beneficiaries: A farmer shall be eligible to \nreceive MISS benefit through multiple KCC subject to an overall limit of \u20b93 lakh per \nfarmer across all such accounts. However, he/she shall be eligible to receive MISS \nbenefits for a specific land parcel through only one Kisan Credit Card (KCC) \naccount. In cases where a farmer maintains multiple KCC accounts linked to the \n4 \n \nsame land parcel, MISS benefit shall be extended only to the account with the \nhighest sanctioned loan amount, subject to the overall limit. \n(iii) \nEncouraging Digital Transactions: Banks may encourage farmers to utilize all \navailable digital banking channels, including RuPay cards, for seamless account \noperations and transactions. \n(iv) \nReporting of Data: Banks are advised to capture and report the requisite granular \ndata of individual farmer beneficiaries under the scheme, including their social \ncategory, on the KRP and ensure that such data is not changed in subsequent \nperiods. This data should be reported accurately to facilitate the settlement of \naudited MISS claims for the year 2025\u201326. \n(v) \nAccurate Crop Reporting on KRP: Field functionaries must exercise due \ndiligence in accurately reporting the data on crops sown on the KRP. Failure to do \nso may lead to validation errors at a later stage. \n(vi) \nSubmission of MISS Claims on KRP: All eligible financial institutions shall strictly \nfollow the operational instructions and ensure timely uploading of MISS claims on \nKRP, duly certified by their Statutory Auditors as true and correct, as per date \nnotified from time to time. \n(vii) \nSubmission of Claims by PACS Ceded with SCBs: The claims in respect of \ncomputerized PACS ceded with SCBs may be uploaded separately by the \nrespective banks, with the certification that interest subvention/prompt repayment \nincentive is being claimed on loans for which no refinance has been availed from \nNABARD, duly certified by the banks\u2019 Statutory Auditors, through KRP module.  \nYours faithfully, \n \n(R.
