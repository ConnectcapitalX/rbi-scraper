The above amendment shall come into force with immediate effect. \nYours faithfully, \n \n(Nisha Nambiar) \nChief General Manager-in-Charge \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n \n   Annex IIIA \n\u201cPriority Sector Lending Certificates - Scheme \ni) Purpose: To enable banks to achieve the priority sector lending target and \nsub-targets by purchase of these instruments in the event of shortfall and at the \nsame time incentivize the surplus banks; thereby enhancing lending to the \ncategories under priority sector. \nii) Nature of the Instruments: The seller will be selling fulfilment of priority sector \nobligation and the buyer would be buying the same. There will be no transfer of \nrisks or loan assets. \niii) Modalities: The PSLCs will be traded through the CBS portal (e-Kuber) of \nRBI. The detailed operational instructions for carrying out the trades are \navailable through the e-Kuber portal. \niv) Sellers/Buyers: Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs), Regional Rural \nBanks (RRBs), Local Area Banks (LABs), Small Finance Banks (SFBs) and \nUrban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) who have originated PSL eligible category \nloans subject to such regulations as may be issued by the Bank. \nv) Types of PSLCs: There would be four kinds of PSLCs :\u2013 \ni) PSLC Agriculture: Counting for achievement towards the total agriculture \nlending target. \nii) PSLC SF/MF: Counting for achievement towards the sub-target for lending \nto Small and Marginal Farmers. \niii) PSLC Micro Enterprises: Counting for achievement towards the sub target \nfor lending to Micro Enterprises. \niv) PSLC General: Counting for achievement towards the overall priority sector \ntarget. \nAs stated in the Master Directions - Reserve Bank of India (Priority Sector \nLending \u2013 Targets and Classification) Directions, 2025, Priority Sector \ncomprises several categories, including Agriculture and Micro Enterprises. In \naddition to the overall target and sectoral targets for lending to agriculture and \n \n12 \n \nmicro enterprises, banks are required to achieve specified sub-target for \nlending to Small and Marginal Farmers. Accordingly, to avoid computational \nissues in assessing the achievement/shortfall of PSL targets, it is advised that \nthe above four types of certificates will represent specific loans and count for \nspecific sub-targets/targets as indicated hereunder: \nS. \nNo. \nType of PSLCs \nRepresenting \nCounting for \n1. PSLC \n- \nAgriculture \nAll eligible Agriculture \nloans except loans to \nSF/MF \nfor \nwhich \nseparate \ncertificates \nare available \nAchievement \nof \nagriculture \ntarget and overall PSL target \n2. PSLC - SF/MF \nAll eligible loans to \nsmall/marginal farmers \nAchievement of SF/MF sub-\ntarget, Weaker Sections sub-\ntarget, \nNCF \nsub-target, \nagriculture target and overall \nPSL target \n3. PSLC \n- \nMicro \nEnterprises \nAll PSL Loans to Micro \nEnterprises \nAchievement \nof \nmicro-\nenterprise \nsub-target \nand \noverall PSL target \n4. PSLC - General The residual priority \nsector loans i.e. other \nthan \nloans \nto \nagriculture and micro \nenterprises for which \nseparate \ncertificates \nare available \nAchievement of overall PSL \ntarget \n \nThus, a bank having shortfall in achievement of any sub-target (e.g. SF/MF, \nMicro), will have to buy the specific PSLC to achieve the target. However, if a \nbank is having shortfall in achievement of the overall target only, as applicable \nto it, may buy any of the available PSLCs. \n \n13 \n \nvi) Computation of PSL achievement: A bank\u2019s PSL achievement would be \ncomputed as the sum of outstanding priority sector loans, and the net nominal \nvalue of the PSLCs issued and purchased. Such computation will be done \nseparately where sub targets are prescribed as on the reporting date. \nvii) Amount eligible for issue: Normally PSLCs will be issued against the \nunderlying assets. However, with the objective of developing a strong and \nvibrant market for PSLCs, a bank is permitted to issue PSLCs upto 50 percent \nof previous year\u2019s PSL achievement without having the underlying in its books. \nHowever, as on the reporting date, the bank must have met the priority sector \ntarget by way of the sum of outstanding priority sector lending portfolio and net \nof PSLCs issued and purchased. To the extent of shortfall in the achievement \nof target, banks may be required to invest in RIDF/other funds as hitherto. \nviii) Credit Risk: There will be no transfer of credit risk on the underlying as there \nis no transfer of tangible assets or cash flow. \nix) Expiry date: All PSLCs will expire by March 31st and will not be valid beyond \nthe reporting date (March 31st), irrespective of the date it was first sold. \nx) Settlement: The settlement of funds will be done through the platform as \nexplained in the e-Kuber portal. \nxi) Value and Fee: The nominal value of PSLC would represent the equivalent \nof the PSL that would get deducted from the PSL portfolio of the seller and \nadded to the PSL portfolio of the buyer. The buyer would pay a fee to the seller \nwhich will be market determined. \nxii) Lot Size: The PSLCs would have a standard lot size of \u20b9 25 lakh and \nmultiples thereof. \nxiii) Accounting: The fee paid for purchase of the PSLC would be treated as an \n\u2018Expense\u2019 and the fee received for the sale of PSLCs would be treated as \n\u2018Miscellaneous Income\u2019. \nxiv) Disclosures: Both seller and buyer shall report the amount of PSLCs \n(category-wise) sold and purchased during the year in the \u2018Disclosures to the \nBalance Sheet\u2019. \n \n14 \n \nIllustration: \n1. Bank A may sell PSLCs with a nominal value of \u20b9100 crores to Bank B on \nJuly 15, 2025. Bank B will reckon \u20b9100 crore towards its priority sector \nachievement as on the reporting dates of September 30, 2025, December 31, \n2025 & March 31, 2026, while Bank A will subtract the same from its \nachievement figures for the respective reporting dates. The PSLC will expire by \nMarch 31, 2026. \n2. Bank C may buy \u20b9100 crore PSLC on March 30, 2026 from Bank D. Bank D \nwill subtract \u20b9100 crore from its PSL reporting on March 31, 2026 while Bank C \nwill reckon the same towards its achievement. The PSLC will expire by March \n31, 2026.\u201d \n \n \n",
