However, Reserve Bank\u2019s supervisory reviews have indicated \ndivergent practices amongst Regulated Entities (REs) with regard to levy of pre-payment \ncharges in case of loans sanctioned to MSEs which lead to customer grievances and \ndisputes. Further, certain REs have been found to include restrictive clauses in loan \ncontracts/ agreements to deter borrowers from switching over to another lender, either \nfor availing lower rates of interest or better terms of service. Accordingly, as announced \nin the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies dated October 9, 2024, a \ndraft circular in this regard was issued on February 21, 2025 for public consultation. \n2. Based on a review of the supervisory findings and public feedback received on the \ndraft circular, the Reserve Bank, in exercise of the powers conferred by Sections 21, 35A \nand 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, Sections 45JA, 45L and 45M of the Reserve \nBank of India Act, 1934 and Section 30A of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987, hereby \nissues the Directions hereinafter specified.  \n \n3.(i) These Directions shall be called the Reserve Bank of India (Pre-payment Charges \non Loans) Directions, 2025. \n(ii) These Directions shall be applicable to all loans2 and advances sanctioned or \nrenewed on or after January 1, 2026.  \n \n                                                            \n1 As defined in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006 \n2 The term \u2018loans\u2019, for the purpose of this circular, shall include term loans as well as demand loans \n2 \n \n4. These Directions shall apply to all commercial banks (excluding payments banks), co-\noperative banks, NBFCs and All India Financial Institutions.  \n \n5. An RE shall adhere to the following Directions regarding levy of pre-payment charges \non all floating rate loans and advances: \n(i)  For all loans granted for purposes other than business to individuals, with or without \nco-obligant(s), an RE shall not levy pre-payment charges;  \n(ii) For all loans granted for business purpose to individuals and MSEs, with or without \nco-obligant(s):  \n(a) A commercial bank (excluding Small Finance bank, Regional Rural bank and \nLocal Area bank), a Tier 4 Primary (Urban) Co-operative bank, an NBFC-UL, and \nan All India Financial Institution shall not levy any pre-payment charges.  \n(b) A Small Finance bank, a Regional Rural bank, a Tier 3 Primary (Urban) Co-\noperative bank, State Cooperative bank, Central Cooperative bank and an NBFC-\nML shall not levy any pre-payment charges on loans with sanctioned amount/ limit \nup to \u20b950 lakh. \n(iii) The Directions at paragraphs 5(i) and 5(ii) above shall be applicable irrespective of \nthe source of funds used for pre-payment of loans, either in part or in full, and without any \nminimum lock-in period. \n(iv) Applicability of above Directions for dual/ special rate (combination of fixed and \nfloating rate) loans will depend on whether the loan is on floating rate at the time of pre-\npayment.  \n \n6. In cases other than those mentioned at paragraphs 5(i) and 5(ii) above, pre-payment \ncharges, if any, shall be as per the approved policy of the RE. However, in case of term \nloans, pre-payment charges, if levied by the RE, shall be based on the amount being \nprepaid. In case of cash credit/ overdraft facilities, pre-payment charges on closure of the \nfacility before the due date shall be levied on an amount not exceeding the sanctioned \nlimit. \n \n7. In case of cash credit/ overdraft facilities, no pre-payment charges shall be applicable \nif the borrower intimates the RE of his/ her/ its intention not to renew the facility before \nthe period as stipulated in the loan agreement, provided that the facility gets closed on \n3 \n \nthe due date. \n \n8. An RE shall not levy any charges where pre-payment is effected at the instance of the \nRE. \n \n9. The applicability or otherwise of pre-payment charges shall be clearly disclosed in the \nsanction letter and loan agreement. Further, in case of loans and advances where Key \nFacts Statement (KFS) is to be provided as specified in the Reserve Bank\u2019s circular dated \nApril 15, 2024 on \u2018Key Facts Statement for Loans and Advances\u2019, the same shall also be \nmentioned in the KFS. No pre-payment charges which have not been disclosed as \nspecified herein shall be charged by an RE. \n \n10. An RE shall not levy any charges/ fees retrospectively at the time of pre-payment of \nloans, which were waived off earlier by the RE. \n \n11. Repeal Provisions \nWith the issue of these Directions, the instructions contained in the circulars/ Master \nDirections mentioned in Annex, issued by the Reserve Bank, shall stand repealed from \nthe effective date of these Directions. All the repealed circulars shall be deemed to have \nbeen in force during the relevant periods, prior to the coming into effect of these \ninstructions.  \n \n(Veena Srivastava) \nChief General Manager \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \n  Annex \n \nList of circulars/ instructions in Master Directions repealed \nSr. \nNo. \nCircular No. \nDate \nSubject \n1. \nDBOD.No.Dir.BC.107/13.03.0\n0/2011-12 \nJune 5, 2012 \nHome Loans - Levy of Fore-\nclosure \nCharges/ \nPre-\npayment Penalty \n2. \nRPCD.CO.RCBD.BC.No.84/0\n3.03.01/2011-12 \nJune 15, 2012 \nHome Loans - Levy of Fore - \nClosure \nCharges/ \nPre-\npayment Penalty \n3. \nRPCD.CO.RRB.BC.No.85/03.\n05.033/2011-12 \nJune 18, 2012 \nHome Loans - Levy of Fore - \nClosure \nCharges/ \nPre-\npayment Penalty \n4. \nUBD.BPD.(PCB)CIR.No.41/12\n.05.001/2011-12 \nJune 26, 2012 \nHome Loans - Levy of Fore-\nclosure \nCharges/ \nPre-\npayment Penalty by Urban \nCo-operative Banks (UCBs) \n5. \nDBOD.Dir.BC.No.110/13.03.0\n0/2013-14 \nMay 7, 2014 \nLevy of Foreclosure Charges/ \nPre-payment \nPenalty \non \nFloating Rate Term Loans \n6. \nUBD.CO.BPD.PCB.Cir.No.64/\n12.05.001/2013-14 \nMay 26, 2014 \nLevy of Foreclosure Charges/ \nPre-payment \nPenalty \non \nFloating Rate Term Loans \n7. \nRPCD.CO.RCBD.RRB.BC.No.\n102/07.51.013/2013-14 \nMay 27, 2014 \nLevy of Foreclosure Charges/ \nPre-payment \nPenalty \non \nFloating Rate Term Loans \n8. \nDBR.Dir.BC.No.08/13.03.00/2\n019-20 \nAugust 2, 2019 Levy of Foreclosure Charges/ \nPre-payment \nPenalty \non \nFloating Rate Term Loans \n9. \nMaster \nDirection \n\u2013 \nNon-\nBanking Financial Company \u2013 \nHousing Finance Company \n(Reserve \nBank) \nDirections, \n2021 \nFebruary 17, \n2021 (as \namended from \ntime to time) \nParagraph 85.7 \n10.
