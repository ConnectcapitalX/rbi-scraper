Introduction \nThe nomination facility is intended to facilitate expeditious settlement of claims by \nbanks upon death of a deceased customer and to minimise hardship faced by the \nfamily members. The Government of India has notified the Banking Laws \n(Amendment) Act, 2025 which inter-alia has amended the Sections 45ZA, 45ZC and \n45ZE of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (the Act). The Banking Companies \n(Nomination) Rules, 2025 have also been notified which along with amended \nprovisions of the Act shall come into force from November 1, 2025.  Accordingly, in \norder to align the regulatory instructions with the amended provisions of the Banking \nRegulation Act, 1949 and corresponding Nomination Rules, it has been decided to \nreview the extant instructions on the subject.   \n \nII. Preliminary \nA. Preamble \n2. These Directions are issued to provide regulatory instructions to banks to implement \nthe nomination facility and shall be read with sections 45ZA to 45ZG of the Banking \nRegulation Act, 1949 (and with section 56 of the Act ibid when applied to cooperative \nbanks) and the Nomination Rules framed thereunder. \n \nB. Powers Exercised \n3. In exercise of the powers conferred by section 35A of the Banking Regulation \nAct,1949 (read with section 56 of the Act ibid when applied to cooperative banks), the \nReserve Bank of India (hereinafter called the Reserve Bank), being satisfied that it is \nnecessary and expedient in public interest to do so, hereby issues the following \nDirections. \n2 \n \n \nC. Short Title \n4. These Directions shall be called the Reserve Bank of India (Nomination Facility in \nDeposit Accounts, Safe Deposit Lockers and Articles kept in Safe Custody with the \nBanks) Directions, 2025. \n \nD. Effective Date \n5. These Directions shall come into force with effect from November 1, 2025.  \n \nE. Applicability \n6. These Directions shall apply to all banks. \n \nF. Definitions \n7. In these Directions, unless the context otherwise requires, \n(a) \u2018Act\u2019 refers to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. \n(b) \u2018Bank\u2019 refers to a banking company, corresponding new bank, State Bank of India, \nRegional Rural Bank and Cooperative Bank, as defined in the Act.  \n(c) \u2018Rules\u2019 refers to the Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules, 2025. \n \nIII. Nomination Facility in Deposit Accounts, Safe Deposit Lockers and Articles \nkept in Safe Custody \nG. Nomination Facility \n8.(1) A bank shall offer nomination facility in deposit accounts in accordance with the \nprovisions of sections 45ZA, 45ZB and 45ZG of the Act (read with section 56 of the \nAct when applied to cooperative banks) and the Rules.  \n(2) A bank shall be guided by the provisions of sections 45ZC to 45ZG of the Act (read \nwith section 56 of the Act when applied to cooperative banks) and the Rules in the \nmatter of nomination in safe deposit lockers and articles kept in safe custody. \nExplanation: For the purpose of these Directions, it is clarified that if an \nindividual is keeping an account for his/ her proprietorship business, it will be \ndeemed as that individual\u2019s account and the nomination facility shall be offered \nin such accounts. \n \nH. Option to the customers not to make a nomination  \n9.(1) At the time of account opening, a bank shall explicitly inform the prospective \n3 \n \ncustomer of the availability and purpose of the nomination facility and offer him/her \nthe option to avail the same. The bank shall also clearly explain to the prospective \ncustomer the advantages of the nomination facility, including but not limited to \nsimplification of the claim process in the event of the account holder\u2019s demise and \nfacilitation of smooth and prompt transfer of funds to the nominee without legal \ncomplications. \n(2) If the prospective customer chooses not to avail the nomination facility despite \nbeing fully informed, the bank shall proceed to open the deposit account without \nimposing any restrictions, if otherwise found eligible, after obtaining a written \ndeclaration from the individual confirming that he/ she does not require the nomination \nfacility at the time of account opening. If he/she refuses to provide the written \ndeclaration, the bank shall record the fact of refusal to submit written confirmation in \nthe account opening records. \n(3) Under no circumstances shall a prospective customer be denied or delayed in \nopening an account solely on the ground of refusal to make a nomination, provided \nall other requirements for account opening are satisfactorily met. \n \nI. Incidental Matters  \n10. In case of simultaneous nomination, if any nominee dies prior to receiving the \ndeposit from the bank, the nomination in respect of such nominee alone shall become \nineffective. Accordingly, a bank shall settle the claims of the amount of deposit made \nin favour of such nominee in accordance with provisions applicable for accounts \nwithout nominee clause as contained in Reserve Bank of India (Settlement of Claims \nin respect of Deceased Customers of Banks) Directions, 2025 as amended from time \nto time.   \n11. A bank cannot claim a valid discharge under the provisions of the Act if payments \nare made to individuals based on nomination made under any other law for specified \npurposes.   \n12. A bank shall have in place appropriate systems and procedures to register in its \nbooks the registration, cancellation and variation of the nomination, as per the request \nof the customers. \n13.(1) A bank shall devise proper systems for acknowledging the receipt of the duly \ncompleted forms of registration, cancellation and/ or variation of the nomination.  \n4 \n \n(2) A bank shall verify and ensure that the nomination(s) made by its customers are in \naccordance with relevant provisions of the Act and the Rules before providing \nacknowledgement to them. \n(3) Such acknowledgement shall be given to the customers within three working days \nof receiving the forms of registration, cancellation and/ or variation of nomination, \nirrespective of whether the same is asked for by the customers.  \n(4) Where a nomination request is found not to be in conformity with the provisions of \nthe Act or the Rules and is consequently rejected, the bank shall inform the customer \nin writing, clearly indicating the reasons for such rejection, within three working days \nof the receipt of the request form. \n \nJ. Details of nomination and name of nominee in Passbook/ Statement of \nAccount and Term Deposit Receipt (TDR) \n14.(1) A bank shall record the status regarding registration of nomination on the face \nof the passbook/ Statement of Account and TDR, with the legend \"Nomination \nRegistered\".  \n(2) A bank shall also indicate the name of the Nominee(s) in the Passbook/ Statement \nof Accounts and TDR in such cases. \n \nK. Customer guidance and publicity of benefits of nomination \n15.(1) A bank shall give wide publicity and provide guidance to deposit account \nholders, locker hirers and depositors of articles in safe custody on the benefits of the \nnomination facility.  This may include printing compatible messages on cheque book, \npassbook and other literature reaching the customers as well as launching periodical \nawareness drives. \n(2) A bank shall ensure that the form for opening deposit accounts, hiring safe deposit \nlockers and depositing articles in safe custody contains space for getting the details of \nnomination, which also serves the purpose of educating the customers about \navailability of such facility.  \n \nIV. Miscellaneous \nL.
