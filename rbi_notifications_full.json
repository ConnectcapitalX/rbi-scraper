The Amendment Directions modifies the Directions as under: \n(1) Chapter XI \u2013 \u2018Opening of Current Accounts and CC / OD Accounts by \nBanks\u2019 of the Directions shall be deleted and substituted with a new chapter \nas under: \nChapter XIA - Maintenance of Cash Credit Accounts, Current \nAccounts and Overdraft Accounts by Banks \n91A. \nCurrent Accounts, Cash Credit Accounts (CC), and Overdraft \nAccounts (OD) may all be used as transaction accounts by the \ncustomers, which raises concerns relating to credit monitoring by the \nlenders. With a view to strengthening credit discipline and facilitating \nbetter monitoring of transactions and utilisation of funds, this Chapter \nprovides a framework for maintaining such accounts banks.   \nA. Cash Credit Accounts \n91B. \nCC account is operationally different from a current account or \nOD account, given its primary nature as a working capital facility linked \nto the value of the borrower's current assets. A bank may provide such \nReserve Bank of India (Commercial Banks \u2013 Credit Risk Management) \u2013 Amendment Directions, 2025 \n \n2 \n \ncash credit facilities as per the needs of the customer, without any \nrestriction under this Chapter. \nB. Current Accounts and OD Accounts  \n91C. \nA bank may maintain current account or OD account without any \nrestriction in case of customers where the aggregate exposure of the \nbanking system to the customer is less than \u20b910 crore. \nExplanation (1): \u2018Banking System\u2019 for the purpose of this Chapter shall \ninclude Commercial Banks (including Small Finance Banks, Local Area \nBanks, and Regional Rural Banks, but excluding Payments Banks), \nUrban Co-operative Banks and Rural Co-operative Banks (State Co-\noperative Banks and Central Co-operative Banks). \nExplanation (2): \u2018Exposure\u2019 for the purpose of this Chapter means the \nsum of all sanctioned fund-based credit facilities and non-fund-based \nfacilities availed by the borrower from the banking system. \n91D. \nIn case of customers to whom the exposure of the banking system \nis \u20b910 crore or more:  \n(1) A bank may maintain current accounts or OD accounts as per the \nneeds of the customer provided that the bank has either: \n(i) \nA minimum 10 per cent share in banking system\u2019s aggregate \nexposure to the borrower; or  \n(ii) \nA minimum 10 per cent share in banking system\u2019s aggregate \nfund-based exposure to the borrower. \nProvided that, in case no bank within the banking system meets the \nabove criteria, or only one bank meets the above criteria, two banks \nfrom the banking system having the largest exposures to the borrower \nmay maintain current accounts or OD accounts. \nProvided further that, in case where only one bank within the banking \nsystem has any exposure to the borrower, one more bank of the \ncustomer\u2019s choice within the banking system may maintain current \nReserve Bank of India (Commercial Banks \u2013 Credit Risk Management) \u2013 Amendment Directions, 2025 \n \n3 \n \naccounts, subject to furnishing of a no-objection certificate (NOC) from \nthe bank that has the exposure to the borrower. \nProvided further that, in case where no Scheduled Commercial Bank \n(SCB) meets the above criteria, but the borrower nevertheless desires \nto have a current account with an SCB, such borrowers may maintain \ncurrent accounts with any one SCB of their choice, subject to furnishing \nof NOCs from all lending banks within the banking system.  \n(2) A bank, not meeting the eligibility criteria at paragraph (1) above , \nmay maintain only collection accounts. \nExplanation: \u2018Collection Account\u2019 for the purpose of this Chapter \nmeans a current account or OD account used primarily for receipts \nof cash inflows of the accountholder. Restricted payments / cash \noutflows from such account shall be subject to the conditions \noutlined in paragraph 91F of these Directions. \n91E. \nWith a view to ensuring credit discipline, lenders may include \nadditional covenants as per their policies in their loan agreements in \nmutual agreement with borrowers.   \nC. Collection Accounts  \n91F. \nFunds credited into a collection account shall be remitted within \ntwo working days of receipt of such funds to a CC account, current \naccount, or OD account maintained with any bank in the banking \nsystem and designated by the borrower for this purpose (hereinafter \nreferred to as \u2018designated account\u2019 in this Chapter). Any disbursement \nof overdraft limit from an OD account, which is in the nature of a \ncollection account, shall be through the designated account only. \nProvided that statutory dues such as taxes, and dues, if any, to the \nbank maintaining the collection account may be debited before \nremitting the funds. \nD. Exemptions \n91G. \nThe restrictions placed in terms of paragraph 91D(1) of these \nDirections shall not be applicable to the accounts mentioned below: \nReserve Bank of India (Commercial Banks \u2013 Credit Risk Management) \u2013 Amendment Directions, 2025 \n \n4 \n \n(1) Accounts opened as per the provisions of Foreign Exchange \nManagement Act, 1999 (FEMA) and notifications issued \nthereunder, including accounts mandated for ensuring compliance \nunder the FEMA framework. \n(2) Specific accounts or transactions which are stipulated under a \nstatute or a specific instruction of a financial sector regulator, or the \nCentral Government or a State Government. \nExplanation: \u2018Financial sector regulator\u2019 for the purpose of this \nChapter refers to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Securities \nand Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the Insurance Regulatory and \nDevelopment Authority of India (IRDAI) and the Pension Fund \nRegulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA). \n(3) Accounts of entities regulated by a financial sector regulator, used \nfor the purpose of carrying out their regulated activities. \nProvided that banks operating the above-mentioned exempted \naccounts shall ensure that transactions in such accounts are used only \nfor the permitted / specified purposes. Surplus funds, if any, in such \naccounts shall be remitted to the designated account. \n91H. \nBanks, in certain cases, offer products or services that inherently \nrequire routing transactions through a current account maintained with \nthemselves. In such cases, banks which are otherwise not eligible to \nmaintain accounts in terms of paragraph 91D(1) of these Directions \nmay also maintain current accounts, subject to the conditions specified \nbelow: \n(1) Such accounts shall only be opened in accordance with a Board-\napproved policy for the product / service, which shall detail and \njustify, inter alia, the necessity of operating these accounts. \n(2) Transactions in such accounts shall be limited for the specified \npurpose(s). Cash transactions, debits at the discretion of \ncustomers, and issuance of instruments like electronic cards and \ncheque books shall not be permitted in such accounts. Surplus \nReserve Bank of India (Commercial Banks \u2013 Credit Risk Management) \u2013 Amendment Directions, 2025 \n \n5 \n \nfunds, if any, in such accounts shall be remitted to the designated \naccount. \n(3) Banks shall implement adequate safeguards to ensure that such \naccounts are not used as substitutes for current accounts, or \nemployed to circumvent restrictions placed on current accounts, or \nmisused for activities such as fund diversion or fraud. \nE. Compliance Monitoring \n91I. \nFor the purpose of ensuring ongoing compliance with this \nChapter, all banks shall monitor accounts maintained with them on a \nregular basis, and in any case at least once every half-year.  \n91J. \nIn case it is observed that a bank is no longer eligible to maintain \na current account or OD account opened in terms of: \n(1) paragraph 91C due to increase in exposure of banking system to \nthe borrower up to or beyond the specified threshold of \u20b910 crore; \nor \n(2) paragraph 91D(1), due to changes in the bank\u2019s share in banking \nsystem\u2019s aggregate exposure or in aggregate fund-based exposure \nto the borrower; or due to non-availability of NOC from banks that \nhave exposure to the borrower; \nthen the bank shall notify the customer(s) concerned promptly, and in \nany case within one month from the date of observing such ineligibility, \nthat the account must either be converted to a collection account or \nclosed. The conversion or closure process, as the case may be, shall \nbe completed within three months of observing such ineligibility. \n91K. \nAccounts opened in terms of these Directions shall be \nappropriately flagged in the bank\u2019s core banking solution (CBS) to \nensure clear identification and to facilitate effective monitoring. Banks \nmaintaining multiple accounts for a borrower shall ensure that such \naccounts and transactions and cashflows therein are monitored at the \nborrower level as also at the account level. \nReserve Bank of India (Commercial Banks \u2013 Credit Risk Management) \u2013 Amendment Directions, 2025 \n \n6 \n \nF. Other Provisions  \n91L. \nA bank shall ensure that an accountholder utilise their account \nsolely for transactions related to their authorised business or activities. \nThese accounts shall not, under any circumstances, be used as pass-\nthrough channels for facilitating third-party transactions.  \nProvided that entities expressly licensed or authorised by a financial \nsector regulator to facilitate third-party transactions may continue to do \nso. However, such activities shall strictly be limited to the specific \ntransactions they are authorised to do and shall not extend beyond that \nscope.
